PROMPT: Initial Analysis (user)

You will be provided a summary of a research paper as well as a set of computational analyses that were previously attempted for the given single-cell transcriptomic Andata dataset.
Your role is to provide a new computational analysis plan that is completely distinct from the analyses in the paper AND from those that were previously attempted.
Propose analyses that you think are missing from the paper. Ensure these are standard single-cell analyses.
Specifically, you will return a hypothesis, a series of analysis steps towards testing that hypothesis, and finally the python code for executing the first analysis step.

Ensure that your output is in the specified JSON format. For the code_description field, be very specific about what this particular code step does - mention the specific functions, data transformations, and computations being performed.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /home/groups/jamesz/salber/CellVoyager/example/covid19.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never save them to a file.
    13. The analyses should be standard and should be analyses you think the paper missed.

Here is a summary of core single-cell analyses commonly done with the python libraries available to you:
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.



For the analysis plan, think of the analysis plan as a scientific workflow:
    1. Start with exploratory data analysis that is broad and tests many things
    2. Then, focus on the more promising results from the exploratory phase by creating more focused analyses
    3. Include statistical validation of your results where appropiate
Do not number the analysis plan.
Each step in the analysis plan should be distinct from one another and could involve loading the data, conducting a statistical analysis, printing information about the AnnData object, etc.
Use however many steps is appropiate, but go for at least 5 steps.

Here is a summary of the research paper:
Biological background  
The paper focuses on severe COVID-19, a condition induced by SARS‑CoV‑2 infection that, in a subset of patients, progresses to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring intensive care. Given the high morbidity and mortality associated with severe disease, understanding the underlying immune responses is crucial. The study investigates how the peripheral immune compartment, particularly within the blood, responds during severe COVID-19 and the potential mechanisms that could both drive immunopathology and contribute to protective immunity.

Biological background  
Key biological questions addressed include how different immune cell subsets are reconfigured during severe COVID-19, the role of specific cells in processes like cytokine release syndrome, and whether peripheral immune cells contribute to the cytokine storm widely feared in these patients. The authors also evaluate the extent of interferon-driven gene expression and the dysregulation of antigen presentation molecules (e.g. HLA class II), alongside the emergence of unusual cell populations such as developing neutrophils, to provide a comprehensive view of the immune alterations in severe cases.

Paper’s computational analyses  
The first computational workflow involved processing Seq-Well scRNA‑seq data from 44,721 cells isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients and controls. Using the Seurat package, the authors performed data scaling, transformation, and variable gene identification via SCTransform(). Dimensionality reduction through PCA followed by UMAP embedding and graph‑based clustering (using the Louvain method) resulted in the identification of 30 clusters corresponding to diverse immune cell types. Differential expression (DE) analysis using the Wilcoxon rank‑sum test allowed manual annotation of these clusters according to known immune markers. This preliminary analysis revealed significant phenotypic differences between COVID‑19 patients and healthy individuals, particularly among monocytes, T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells.

Paper’s computational analyses  
A series of focused analyses on cell type proportions was then conducted; the authors quantified changes in immune cell subset frequencies between COVID‑19 and control samples. They found that several innate immune subsets—including γδ T cells, plasmacytoid and conventional dendritic cells, CD16+ monocytes, and some NK cell populations—were substantially depleted, especially in patients with ARDS. Conversely, plasmablast proportions were increased, particularly in more severe cases, suggesting a robust humoral response. In addition, a novel “developing neutrophil” population was identified that expressed neutrophil granule protein genes (e.g., ELANE, LTF, MMP8) but lacked canonical neutrophil surface markers, hinting at a differentiation continuum potentially linked to emergency granulopoiesis.

Paper’s computational analyses  
The authors then performed in-depth analyses on specific immune compartments. For monocytes, UMAP‐based subclustering distinguished CD14+ and CD16+ subsets, revealing a strong phenotypic shift where CD14+ monocytes dominated while CD16+ were depleted. DE analysis in monocytes indicated little to no expression of pro‑inflammatory cytokine genes such as TNF, IL6, or IL1B, opposing the notion that peripheral monocytes drive the cytokine storm. Instead, a remarkable downregulation of HLA class II genes was noted—more pronounced in ventilated patients—and an interferon‑stimulated gene (ISG) signature was variably present, with regulatory analysis suggesting differential IFN and IRF activity across patients. In parallel, analyses of T and NK cells via UMAP identified distinct populations (CD4+ T, CD8+ T and NK cells) with further DE and pathway‐enrichment analyses showing depletion of specific NK subsets (CD56dim, CD56bright) and an inconclusive evidence of T cell exhaustion. Additionally, a focused RNA velocity analysis on plasmablasts and developing neutrophils revealed a differentiation bridge: cells transitioned from an Ig gene‑expressing plasmablast state to progressively express neutrophil granule proteins, with transcription factors (CEBPE and CEBPD) marking this continuum. This trajectory analysis suggests potential cellular transdifferentiation events in severe COVID‑19 with ARDS.

Paper’s dataset description  
The dataset comprises single‑cell transcriptomic data obtained from 44,721 cells derived from eight peripheral blood samples collected from seven hospitalized COVID‑19 patients (ranging in age and clinical presentation, including patients with and without ARDS) as well as six healthy control donors. Each sample includes detailed metadata such as donor demographics, time post–symptom onset, ventilation status, and treatment history (e.g., administration of azithromycin or remdesivir), which provides context to the observed cellular phenotypes. In addition to high‑quality scRNA‑seq measurements (including UMIs, gene counts, and quality metrics like mitochondrial and rRNA read percentages), the dataset incorporates downstream DE gene lists, pathway enrichment analyses, upstream regulator predictions, and RNA velocity trajectories. Together, this intricate dataset connects transcriptional dynamics of peripheral immune cells to the pathogenesis and progression of severe COVID‑19, offering a rich resource for dissecting disease immunology and guiding therapeutic strategies.
In severe COVID‐19 patients, dysregulated cell–cell communication mediated by key inflammatory ligand–receptor pairs drives altered interactions between specific immune cell types. In particular, we hypothesize that interactions between monocytes (as major producers of inflammatory ligands) and T cells (as recipients via corresponding receptors) are enhanced in severe COVID‐19 compared to healthy controls. Detecting such changes may help identify communication pathways that contribute to immunopathology.
In severe COVID‐19 patients, we hypothesize that monocytes upregulate inflammatory ligands (e.g., TNF, IL1B, IL6) and T cells simultaneously increase expression of the corresponding receptors (e.g., TNFRSF1A, IL1R1, IL6R). This enhanced expression is expected to boost the communication signaling between monocytes and T cells compared to healthy controls. Such dysregulated communication may contribute to immunopathology in severe COVID‐19.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: initial_analysis

Hypothesis: In severe COVID‐19, the average expression levels of key inflammatory ligands (e.g., TNF, IL1B, IL6) in monocytes are positively correlated with the average expression levels of their corresponding receptors (e.g., TNFRSF1A, IL1R1, IL6R) in T cells, suggesting enhanced ligand‐receptor interplay that may drive immunopathology.

Analysis Plan:
1. Subset the dataset into monocytes (CD14 Monocyte and CD16 Monocyte) and T cells (CD4 T and CD8 T) based on cell_type_coarse.
2. Select the key inflammatory ligand genes (TNF, IL1B, IL6) and their corresponding receptor genes (TNFRSF1A, IL1R1, IL6R).
3. Aggregate expression data by donor using the Donor_full metadata: compute the mean expression for the ligand genes in monocytes and for the receptor genes in T cells for each donor.
4. Separate the aggregated data based on clinical Status (COVID vs Healthy) to evaluate group-specific trends.
5. Perform Pearson correlation analyses for each ligand-receptor pair across donors to determine if higher ligand expression in monocytes is associated with higher receptor expression in T cells; print the correlation coefficients and their significance.
6. Visualize the results by creating scatter plots arranged in a grid, each plot showing the average ligand expression in monocytes versus the average receptor expression in T cells for a given ligand-receptor pair, with points colored by Status.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
In severe COVID‐19, the average expression levels of key inflammatory ligands (e.g., TNF, IL1B, IL6) in monocytes are positively correlated with the average expression levels of their corresponding receptors (e.g., TNFRSF1A, IL1R1, IL6R) in T cells, suggesting enhanced ligand‐receptor interplay that may drive immunopathology.

Analysis Plan:
['Subset the dataset into monocytes (CD14 Monocyte and CD16 Monocyte) and T cells (CD4 T and CD8 T) based on cell_type_coarse.', 'Select the key inflammatory ligand genes (TNF, IL1B, IL6) and their corresponding receptor genes (TNFRSF1A, IL1R1, IL6R).', 'Aggregate expression data by donor using the Donor_full metadata: compute the mean expression for the ligand genes in monocytes and for the receptor genes in T cells for each donor.', 'Separate the aggregated data based on clinical Status (COVID vs Healthy) to evaluate group-specific trends.', 'Perform Pearson correlation analyses for each ligand-receptor pair across donors to determine if higher ligand expression in monocytes is associated with higher receptor expression in T cells; print the correlation coefficients and their significance.', 'Visualize the results by creating scatter plots arranged in a grid, each plot showing the average ligand expression in monocytes versus the average receptor expression in T cells for a given ligand-receptor pair, with points colored by Status.']

Code for first step in analysis plan:
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import scanpy as sc
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define cell type masks
monocyte_mask = adata.obs['cell_type_coarse'].isin(['CD14 Monocyte', 'CD16 Monocyte'])
tcell_mask = adata.obs['cell_type_coarse'].isin(['CD4 T', 'CD8 T'])

# Define the genes of interest
ligand_genes = ['TNF', 'IL1B', 'IL6']
receptor_genes = ['TNFRSF1A', 'IL1R1', 'IL6R']

# Ensure that the gene names exist in adata.var_names
available_ligands = [gene for gene in ligand_genes if gene in adata.var_names]
available_receptors = [gene for gene in receptor_genes if gene in adata.var_names]

# Subset adata for monocytes and T cells

# Create dataframes of expression for the selected genes. We assume expression is in adata.X and convert to a dense array if needed
mono_expr = pd.DataFrame(adata_mono[:, available_ligands].X.toarray() if hasattr(adata_mono.X, 'toarray') else adata_mono.X,
                         index=adata_mono.obs_names, columns=available_ligands)

# Display the aggregated expression data frame
print('Aggregated expression per donor (monocytes and T cells):')
print(avg_expr)

Feedback:
• In the code, there is a typo when attaching T cell metadata: "ntcell_expr['Status']" should be "tcell_expr['Status']". This error could cause a NameError during execution.

• The code correctly subsets the cell types based on the "cell_type_coarse" label and then checks for the presence of the target genes in adata.var_names, which is a good practice.

• Using the toarray() method conditionally when adata.X is sparse properly ensures that the expression data is converted to a dense format when needed.

• The assignment of donor and status metadata to the expression dataframes is handled appropriately prior to performing aggregation.

• When aggregating by "Donor_full", including the "Status" column in the mean calculation is acceptable given the assumption that donor status is uniform. It might be clearer to simply take the unique value for "Status" after grouping or validate that each donor has a single status value.

• The analysis plan is well-structured and novel by focusing on the correlation between specific ligand expression in monocytes and receptor expression in T cells, divided by clinical status. It leverages available metadata and single-cell expression data appropriately.

• The plan’s step for performing Pearson correlation analyses and visualizing the scatter plots in a grid nicely extends the initial aggregation step into deeper statistical testing and visualization.

• Overall, the code is aligned with the provided coding guidelines and analysis plan. Just address the variable name error and consider clarifying the handling of the “Status” column during aggregation for improved clarity and robustness.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /home/groups/jamesz/salber/CellVoyager/example/covid19.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never save them to a file.
    13. The analyses should be standard and should be analyses you think the paper missed.

Here is a summary of core single-cell analyses commonly done with the python libraries available to you:
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: revised_analysis

Revised Hypothesis: In severe COVID‐19, the average expression levels of key inflammatory ligands (e.g., TNF, IL1B, IL6) in monocytes positively correlate with the average expression levels of their corresponding receptors (e.g., TNFRSF1A, IL1R1, IL6R) in T cells, suggesting enhanced ligand‐receptor interplay that may contribute to immunopathology.

Revised Analysis Plan:
1. Subset the dataset into monocytes (CD14 Monocyte and CD16 Monocyte) and T cells (CD4 T and CD8 T) based on the 'cell_type_coarse' label.
2. Select the key inflammatory ligand genes (TNF, IL1B, IL6) and their corresponding receptor genes (TNFRSF1A, IL1R1, IL6R), ensuring they exist in adata.var_names.
3. For each subset, create dataframes of gene expression while attaching donor and status metadata, and then aggregate the data per donor by computing the mean expression of selected genes and separately obtaining the unique donor status.
4. Separate the aggregated data based on clinical Status (COVID vs Healthy) to evaluate group-specific trends.
5. Perform Pearson correlation analyses for each ligand-receptor pair across donors to determine if higher ligand expression in monocytes is associated with higher receptor expression in T cells; print the correlation coefficients and their significance.
6. Visualize the results by creating scatter plots arranged in a grid, each plot showing the average ligand expression in monocytes versus the average receptor expression in T cells for a given ligand-receptor pair, with points colored by Status.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

The current step results indicate that the expression levels of inflammatory cytokines and their corresponding receptors in monocytes and T cells are available for both COVID-19 and healthy control donors. Notably, the expression levels of TNF, IL1B, and IL6 appear to vary between COVID-19 patients and healthy controls. For instance, most COVID-19 patients show reduced expression levels of TNF compared to some of the healthy donors. Similarly, expression levels of cytokine receptors such as TNFRSF1A, IL1R1, and IL6R are also varied. 

Promising Observations:
1. **IL6 Expression:** There is a noticeable increase in IL6 expression in some COVID-19 donors (C6, C7) relative to healthy controls. This could be indicative of a targeted response that aligns with known cytokine release syndrome mechanisms in severe COVID-19.
   
2. **TNF Variability:** The variability in TNF expression among donors could represent potential subgroups within the COVID-19 patient cohort, which could be further explored for clinical correlations or stratifications in disease severity and treatment response.

3. **IL1B Upregulation:** There's significant upregulation of IL1B in a subset of COVID-19 patients, notably C6 and C7. This could potentially indicate these patients are experiencing stronger inflammatory responses, warranting further analysis or consideration in stratified therapeutic approaches.

Future Analysis Suggestions:
1. **Statistical Analysis:** Conduct statistical tests to ascertain whether the observed differences in cytokine and receptor expression are significant between COVID-19 patients and healthy controls. This step will be crucial in confirming enhanced monocyte-T cell communication signaling.

2. **Correlation and Network Analysis:** Explore the correlation between cytokine and receptor expressions across patients, and perform signaling network analyses to map out potential communication pathways that might be enhanced in COVID-19 patients.

3. **Integration with Clinical Data:** Integrate these expression profiles with clinical metadata, such as severity of disease, treatment received, and clinical outcomes, to evaluate potential clinical implications and validate the biological relevance of these findings.

4. **Subpopulation Identification:** Delve deeper into identifying possible subpopulations within the patient cohort that exhibit distinct cytokine and receptor expression patterns. This could reveal new insights into disease heterogeneity and inform personalized medicine approaches.

5. **Validation and Biological Experimentation:** Validate these findings through complementary biological experiments, such as flow cytometry or proteomics, to confirm protein-level expression and functional assays to test cell communication efficacy.

These steps would contribute significantly to validating the hypothesis concerning monocyte and T cell interactions in severe COVID-19 and in identifying novel therapeutic targets.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
Inflammatory ligand and receptor genes exhibit statistically significant differences in expression between COVID‐19 and healthy donors, supporting enhanced monocyte-T cell communication in COVID‐19 patients.

Analysis Plan:
['Perform non-parametric statistical tests (Mann-Whitney U tests) on the aggregated expression data to determine if expression levels for each ligand in monocytes and each receptor in T cells differ significantly between COVID and healthy donors.', 'Conduct Pearson correlation analyses on statistically significant ligand-receptor pairs to examine the strength of association across donors.', 'Visualize the statistically significant differences using boxplots for gene expressions and scatter plots for ligand-receptor correlations with annotated p-values.', 'Overlay additional clinical metadata (such as ventilation status or admission type) on the plots to explore potential clinical correlations.', 'Summarize the findings to evaluate the potential of enhanced monocyte-T cell communication as a mechanistic contributor to severe COVID-19 immunopathology.']

Code for first step in analysis plan:
import pandas as pd
from scipy import stats

# Assume 'avg_expr' DataFrame from previous steps is available
# Also assuming available_ligands and available_receptors contain the original gene lists

# Split aggregated data into COVID and Healthy groups
covid_data = avg_expr[avg_expr['Status'] == 'COVID']
healthy_data = avg_expr[avg_expr['Status'] == 'Healthy']

# Identify the relevant columns for monocyte ligands and T cell receptors
ligand_cols = [gene + '_mono' for gene in available_ligands if gene + '_mono' in avg_expr.columns]
receptor_cols = [gene + '_tcell' for gene in available_receptors if gene + '_tcell' in avg_expr.columns]

# Prepare a dictionary to store statistical test results
stat_results = {}

# Perform Mann-Whitney U tests for each ligand gene in monocytes
for gene in ligand_cols:
    stat, p = stats.mannwhitneyu(covid_data[gene], healthy_data[gene], alternative='two-sided')
    stat_results[gene] = {'U_statistic': stat, 'p_value': p}

# Perform Mann-Whitney U tests for each receptor gene in T cells
for gene in receptor_cols:
    stat, p = stats.mannwhitneyu(covid_data[gene], healthy_data[gene], alternative='two-sided')
    stat_results[gene] = {'U_statistic': stat, 'p_value': p}

# Convert results to a DataFrame and display
results_df = pd.DataFrame(stat_results).T
print('Mann-Whitney U Test Results for Inflammatory Genes (Monocyte ligands and T cell receptors):')
print(results_df)

Feedback:
Feedback on the Python code:
• The code correctly partitions the aggregated donor‐level data by “Status” and identifies the appropriate ligand and receptor columns using suffixes. The structure is clear and aligns with performing Mann–Whitney U tests for each gene.
• Consider adding checks for missing values or insufficient data points before running tests to avoid potential errors when sample sizes are very low.
• It would be useful to include a multiple testing correction (e.g., Benjamini–Hochberg) step on the computed p-values, given that you’re testing multiple genes.
• The code uses a shared results dictionary for both ligands and receptors. Although gene names are expected to be unique with the added suffix, a brief comment clarifying that potential overlap is not an issue would improve clarity.
• Finally, a conditional printout that flags genes meeting a significance threshold could enhance interpretability at this stage.

Feedback on the analysis plan:
• The plan is well aligned with the hypothesis and distinct from the previous clustering and differential expression analyses in the paper.
• The stepwise approach—starting with non‐parametric comparisons, then correlating ligand–receptor pairs, followed by visual overlays with clinical metadata—is logically structured and focused.
• Including subsequent correlation analysis and metadata overlays will help connect the statistical findings to potential clinical outcomes.
• Ensure that the next steps build on the aggregated donor-level data, maintaining consistency with the current analysis workflow.
• The plan could mention a brief rationale for using Mann–Whitney U tests (e.g., non-parametric nature due to non‐normal distribution of donor averages) to strengthen the justification for this method.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /home/groups/jamesz/salber/CellVoyager/example/covid19.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never save them to a file.
    13. The analyses should be standard and should be analyses you think the paper missed.

Here is a summary of core single-cell analyses commonly done with the python libraries available to you:
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

Based on the provided analysis results, it seems that the attempt to identify significant expression differences in inflammatory genes between monocyte ligands and T cell receptors did not yield any significant findings, as indicated by the empty DataFrame and the absence of any listed genes with significant differences.

Here's some feedback and suggestions for future steps:

1. **Re-evaluate Statistical Approach**: Given that the Mann-Whitney U test results show no significant differences, consider re-evaluating the statistical approach. It's essential to ensure the data has been appropriately filtered and normalized to be suitable for the Mann-Whitney U test. You might also consider alternative methods for differential expression analysis that could be more sensitive to the specific characteristics of single-cell data, such as models accounting for over-dispersion or zero inflation.

2. **Examine Data Quality and Batch Effects**: Make sure data preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and batch correction have been properly performed. Single-cell RNA-seq data can be prone to batch effects or other confounding factors that might obscure true biological differences.

3. **Explore Subsetting by Patient Characteristics**: It could be beneficial to stratify the analysis by patient characteristics such as disease severity (e.g., presence of ARDS), age, or treatment history. These factors can lead to heterogeneous responses, and subsetting could help reveal specific patterns of gene expression linked to particular clinical features.

4. **Use Pathway Enrichment Analysis**: Although gene-level differences weren't detected, performing pathway-level enrichment analyses might capture broader changes in signaling pathways between monocytes and T cells. This could bring insight into functional changes despite the lack of individual gene significance.

5. **Focus on Other Immune Cell Interactions**: Since the expected differences were not observed, consider expanding the scope to include other immune cell interactions. The research paper identified several interesting immune subsets and transitions, such as developing neutrophils and the plasmablast-to-neutrophil trajectory. Leveraging these insights might reveal other critical interactions or alternative pathways of cellular communication relevant to severe COVID-19.

6. **Consider Network Analysis**: If individual gene results do not show significance, a network-based approach could help identify regulatory modules or motifs indicating significant interactions.

7. **Integrate Multi-Omics Data**: If additional omics data is available (e.g., proteomics, metabolomics), integrating these datasets could provide a more comprehensive view and potentially reveal subtle transcriptional changes not apparent through transcriptional profiling alone.

By iterating on these points, you may gather insights that align with the original hypothesis or uncover unexpected patterns that broaden the understanding of monocyte-T cell interactions in severe COVID-19.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
Even though differential expression analyses did not reveal significant differences, we hypothesize that the coordinated regulation between monocyte-produced inflammatory ligands and T cell receptors may be captured by a strong positive Pearson correlation across donors, especially within the COVID-19 group.

Analysis Plan:
['Stratify the aggregated donor expression data (avg_expr) into COVID-19 and Healthy groups.', 'For each predefined ligand–receptor pair (TNF-TNFRSF1A, IL1B-IL1R1, IL6-IL6R), compute the Pearson correlation coefficient and associated p-value using the aggregated expression values across donors, both overall and within each clinical group.', 'Visualize the correlation relationships by creating scatter plots for each ligand–receptor pair with regression lines and points colored by clinical status, annotating each plot with the calculated correlation statistics.']

Code for first step in analysis plan:
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.stats import pearsonr

# Define the ligand-receptor pairs based on the column naming in 'avg_expr'
pairs = [("TNF_mono", "TNFRSF1A_tcell"),
         ("IL1B_mono", "IL1R1_tcell"),
         ("IL6_mono", "IL6R_tcell")]

# Compute and print overall Pearson correlations for each pair
def compute_and_print_correlations(data, label):
    print(f"\nCorrelation results for {label} donors:")
    for ligand, receptor in pairs:
        # Ensure there is data for the pair
        if ligand in data.columns and receptor in data.columns:
            x = data[ligand]
            y = data[receptor]
            if len(x.dropna()) >= 3 and len(y.dropna()) >= 3:
                r, p = pearsonr(x, y)
                print(f"{ligand} vs {receptor}: Pearson r = {r:.3f}, p-value = {p:.3g}")
            else:

    x_vals = np.linspace(avg_expr[ligand].min(), avg_expr[ligand].max(), 100)
    y_vals = m * x_vals + b

Feedback:
• Code Feedback:
  - The code is clear and adheres to the allowed libraries. It correctly stratifies the aggregated donor data by "Status" and computes Pearson correlations for each ligand–receptor pair.
  - The function compute_and_print_correlations is concise; however, consider also storing or returning the correlation values for potential later use rather than only printing them.
  - In the scatterplot section, mapping the Status to colors directly is good. It might be helpful to add a legend to improve interpretability.
  - Ensure that dropping missing values is consistently done before both correlation and regression steps.
  - Since the regulation hypothesis assumes coordinated expression, checking the normality of expression distributions might validate the use of Pearson correlation, or consider using Spearman’s if distributions deviate from normality.

• Analysis Plan Feedback:
  - The plan is a fresh approach by exploring cell–cell communication via donor-aggregated correlations, separate from differential expression and clustering analyses in the paper.
  - Stratifying by clinical group (COVID vs Healthy) addresses condition-specific differences and supports the hypothesis.
  - The plan might be enhanced by considering additional visualization (e.g., adding density contours or labeling outlying donors) to capture variation among donors.
  - Future steps should account for potential confounders and sample size limitations when interpreting correlation statistics.
  - Overall, the hypothesis and plan are well-focused on a novel perspective not covered in the original study.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /home/groups/jamesz/salber/CellVoyager/example/covid19.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never save them to a file.
    13. The analyses should be standard and should be analyses you think the paper missed.

Here is a summary of core single-cell analyses commonly done with the python libraries available to you:
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

The current analysis focuses on examining the expression levels of inflammatory cytokines in monocytes and their corresponding receptors in T cells between COVID-19 patients and healthy donors. This aligns with the hypothesis that enhanced signaling interactions between monocytes and T cells contribute to immunopathology in severe COVID-19.

Feedback on Current Results:
1. **Observations and Trends:**
   - Monocytes from COVID-19 patients show varied expression of cytokines such as TNF, IL1B, and IL6. Interestingly, there seems to be a considerable individual variation among COVID-19 samples, which might indicate diverse immune responses.
   - Healthy donors generally exhibit higher baseline TNF expression than many of the COVID-19 patients but show lower IL1B and IL6 expression in monocytes. The elevated TNF expression in controls needs further exploration.
   - T cells from COVID-19 patients show notable variation in receptor expression (TNFRSF1A, IL1R1, IL6R), with some individuals showing elevated receptor levels compared to healthy controls.

2. **Considerations for Future Analyses:**
   - **Correlation Analysis:** Calculate correlation coefficients between the expression of monocyte cytokines and their respective T cell receptors. This will help quantify how changes in one might influence changes in the other.
   - **Cluster Analysis:** Perform sub-clustering within monocytes and T cells to potentially identify specific subtypes with unique expression profiles, as high variability was noted across individuals.
   - **Integration with Prior Data:** Consider integrating these expression profiles with pathway analysis or RNA velocity trajectories to link dynamic changes in gene expression with potential cellular state transitions.
   - **Contextual Analysis:** Analyze this data in the context of the clinical metadata (e.g., ARDS presence, ventilation status) to identify any correlations between immune marker expression and clinical severity.
   - **Comparative Analysis:** Compare these cytokine and receptor levels across other immune cell types identified in previous rounds of clustering to see if similar trends are observed in NK cells or dendritic cells.

3. **Biological Validation:**
   - It’s crucial to validate these findings with in vitro or in vivo models to ensure biological relevance. Focusing on elucidating the functional outcomes of increased ligand-receptor signaling can solidify understanding of the immunopathology in severe COVID-19.

4. **Potential Hypothesis Refinement:**
   - The current results appear somewhat mixed, with varying differences in cytokine levels between patients and controls. A refined hypothesis could explore whether specific subpopulations of monocyte or T cell show dysregulated ligand-receptor interactions in severe cases compared to moderate cases or healthy controls.

By leveraging these insights and analyses, the exploration can be fine-tuned to robustly evaluate the initial hypothesis on dysregulated cytokine signaling pathways driving immunopathology in COVID-19.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
Enhanced ligand–receptor correlations between monocyte cytokine expression and T cell receptor expression are more pronounced in COVID-19 donors than in healthy controls, and this may be accentuated in specific clinical contexts such as ventilated patients.

Analysis Plan:
['Perform Pearson correlation analyses for each ligand-receptor pair (TNF-TNFRSF1A, IL1B-IL1R1, IL6-IL6R) on the aggregated donor-level expression data, stratifying by clinical Status (COVID vs Healthy).', 'Visualize the scatter plots for each ligand-receptor pair in a grid, including linear regression lines and grouping by Status, to assess the strength and direction of the correlation.', 'Integrate additional clinical metadata (e.g., Ventilated status) by annotating the plots or summarizing correlations in a heatmap to further stratify the communication patterns.']

Feedback:
Feedback for the Code:
• The code clearly implements the Pearson correlation workflow on donor‐aggregated data and includes stratification by Status. It adheres to the allowed packages and the outlined analysis plan.
• The use of a dictionary to track correlation results is a good design choice; however, the DataFrame construction for corr_df using a nested comprehension is ambiguous and may lead to unexpected behavior. Consider using a more explicit approach (e.g. iterating over statuses and pairs to build a list of records, then converting that list to a DataFrame).
• It would be helpful to add axis labels (including units or gene identifiers) and more informative legends to the scatter plots. Although the regression lines are plotted per group, including regression equations or confidence intervals would enhance interpretability.
• The code assumes the existence of specific column names (e.g. “TNF_mono”, “TNFRSF1A_tcell”). Verify that these names match exactly those generated by previous steps.
• Consider adding error handling or warnings if the number of data points is very low (beyond the simple check for >2 non‐NaN values) to maintain robustness.
• The plotting section is generally clear; however, adding a combined title or annotation summarizing the overall correlation strength per Status could reinforce the biological insight.

Feedback for the Analysis Plan:
• The hypothesis and plan are clearly articulated and suitably distinct from previous analyses. Focusing on ligand–receptor correlations at the donor level provides a novel angle relative to cell clustering or DE analyses already performed.
• Incorporating ventilation status (and possibly other metadata) later in the workflow would add valuable clinical context; ensure that subsequent steps integrate these features with appropriate visualizations (e.g. annotated scatter plots or heatmaps).
• The plan benefits from a clear, step‐wise approach (correlation analysis, visualization, and integration of metadata), which facilitates reproducibility and interpretation.
• To further extend novelty, consider exploring potential nonlinear relationships or incorporating regression diagnostics that account for donor variability (for example, by using robust linear fits or including confidence intervals).
• Overall, the analysis remains focused on the core hypothesis while leveraging prior aggregation results, which is in line with the provided guidelines and the paper’s context.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /home/groups/jamesz/salber/CellVoyager/example/covid19.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never save them to a file.
    13. The analyses should be standard and should be analyses you think the paper missed.

Here is a summary of core single-cell analyses commonly done with the python libraries available to you:
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

The current results show no significant correlation between inflammatory cytokine ligand-receptor pairs and disease status, as indicated by the high p-values across all measured interactions. However, the IL6-IL6R pair in COVID-19 patients shows a moderate positive correlation (r = 0.517), although it's not statistically significant (p = 0.19). Here's how to proceed:

1. **IL6-IL6R Pair Interest:** 
   - Despite the lack of statistical significance, the moderate correlation might warrant further exploration. Consider increasing the sample size if possible, as this could provide more power to detect potential differences.
   - Explore transforming or normalizing the expression data to assess whether any underlying trends are more detectable.

2. **Data Subsetting and Stratification:**
   - Stratify the data based on clinical parameters (e.g., presence of ARDS, age, sex) to investigate whether they influence the correlation structure in subgroups.
   - Look at different stages of disease severity or time post-symptom onset for dynamic changes in expression.

3. **Alternative Analyses:**
   - Perform a broader ligand-receptor analysis to include other potential signaling pathways, possibly using computational tools designed for cell-cell communication analysis (e.g., CellPhoneDB or NicheNet).
   - Explore gene co-expression networks to identify other interacting partners that might modulate these interactions.

4. **Mechanistic Insights:**
   - Integrate these findings with additional datasets like cytokine protein measurements from plasma or serum to correlate with transcriptomic data.
   - Consider complementary techniques such as flow cytometry or mass cytometry to validate the expression of these receptors and their ligands at the protein level.

5. **Integration with the Original Hypothesis:**
   - Since the premise is about altered communication via upregulated cytokine pathways in severe cases, further exploration of other immune cell interactions and their dynamics could provide robust insights.

Future analyses should also focus on contextualizing these findings with the immune dysregulation observed in severe COVID-19, as suggested by other parts of the paper.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
Stratifying COVID‐19 donors by ventilation status and applying a log1p transformation to the aggregated expression data for IL6 in monocytes and IL6R in T cells will better reveal any enhanced signaling interactions in severe cases, particularly among ventilated patients.

Analysis Plan:
['Merge additional clinical metadata (Ventilated status) into the aggregated donor-level expression data.', 'For COVID-19 donors, apply a log1p transformation to IL6 (monocytes) and IL6R (T cells) expression values and stratify by Ventilated status (Vent vs NonVent). Compute Pearson correlations within each subgroup and visualize scatter plots with fitted regression lines.']

Code for first step in analysis plan:
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from scipy.stats import pearsonr

# Assume avg_expr is available from previous steps
# Retrieve donor-level Ventilated status from adata.obs using monocyte subset as they have metadata
ventilation_info = adata.obs[['Donor_full', 'Ventilated']].drop_duplicates()

# Merge ventilation information into aggregated expression dataframe
avg_expr_vent = pd.merge(avg_expr, ventilation_info, on='Donor_full', how='left')

# Focus on COVID donors only
covid_expr = avg_expr_vent[avg_expr_vent['Status'] == 'COVID'].copy()

# Check if IL6 and IL6R columns exist
if 'IL6_mono' not in covid_expr.columns or 'IL6R_tcell' not in covid_expr.columns:
    raise ValueError('Required columns IL6_mono or IL6R_tcell not found in the aggregated data.')

# Apply log1p normalization to reduce potential outlier effects
covid_expr['log_IL6_mono'] = np.log1p(covid_expr['IL6_mono'])
covid_expr['log_IL6R_tcell'] = np.log1p(covid_expr['IL6R_tcell'])

# Stratify COVID donors by Ventilated status
vent_groups = covid_expr['Ventilated'].unique()

# Set up the plot
sns.set(style='whitegrid', context='notebook', font_scale=1.1)
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, len(vent_groups), figsize=(6 * len(vent_groups), 5), sharey=True)
if len(vent_groups) == 1:
    axes = [axes]

# Dictionary to hold correlation results
corr_results = {}

for ax, vent_status in zip(axes, vent_groups):
    subset = covid_expr[covid_expr['Ventilated'] == vent_status]
    ax.scatter(subset['log_IL6_mono'], subset['log_IL6R_tcell'], s=100, color='tab:blue', edgecolor='k', label='Data points')

    # Check if enough data points are available
    if len(subset) < 3:
        ax.set_title(f'{vent_status} (n={len(subset)})\nInsufficient data')
        continue

    # Perform Pearson correlation
    r_val, p_val = pearsonr(subset['log_IL6_mono'], subset['log_IL6R_tcell'])
    corr_results[vent_status] = {'r': r_val, 'p': p_val}

    # Fit regression line
    m, b = np.polyfit(subset['log_IL6_mono'], subset['log_IL6R_tcell'], 1)
    x_vals = np.linspace(subset['log_IL6_mono'].min(), subset['log_IL6_mono'].max(), 100)
    y_vals = m * x_vals + b
    ax.plot(x_vals, y_vals, color='red', label=f'Fit: y={m:.2f}x+{b:.2f}')

    ax.set_xlabel('log1p(IL6 expression in monocytes)')
    ax.set_ylabel('log1p(IL6R expression in T cells)')
    ax.set_title(f'Ventilated status: {vent_status}\nPearson r = {r_val:.2f}, p = {p_val:.2g}')
    ax.legend()

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

print('Correlation results by ventilation group:')
print(corr_results)

Feedback:
• Analysis Plan Feedback:
  - The hypothesis and plan are focused and novel, emphasizing stratification of COVID‐19 donors by ventilation status and a specific log1p transformation on IL6 (monocytes) and IL6R (T cells). This approach is distinct from prior ligand–receptor analyses in the original paper.
  - The plan adheres to the core goal by isolating a unique interaction that has not been previously highlighted, and it leverages donor‐level metadata in a coherent way.
  - Consider explicitly ordering the ventilation groups (e.g., NonVent then Vent) for consistent plotting and easier interpretation.
  - Including a brief rationale for why log1p transformation is applied (to handle outliers) would strengthen the explanation.

• Code Feedback:
  - The code correctly merges the ventilation metadata from adata.obs into the aggregated donor expression data using a left join on Donor_full, ensuring that clinical metadata is integrated.
  - The filtering for COVID donors is appropriate, and the check for the existence of the “IL6_mono” and “IL6R_tcell” columns prevents runtime errors.
  - The use of np.log1p for transformation is correctly applied.
  - Stratification by the unique values in the "Ventilated" column is correctly implemented; consider sorting these groups to enhance subplot order consistency.
  - Pearson correlation is computed appropriately for each subgroup, and the fitted regression lines via np.polyfit add meaningful context.
  - The plotting section with subplots, scatter points, regression lines, and annotations is clear and informative. One minor note: specifying both facecolor and edgecolor in ax.scatter might trigger warnings in matplotlib for unfilled markers—this is cosmetic but worth noting.
  - Overall, the code follows the specified guidelines and uses only the permitted packages.

Both the analysis plan and code are well-aligned with the goal of providing a novel insight into ventilation-related differences in inflammatory signaling in severe COVID‐19.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /home/groups/jamesz/salber/CellVoyager/example/covid19.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never save them to a file.
    13. The analyses should be standard and should be analyses you think the paper missed.

Here is a summary of core single-cell analyses commonly done with the python libraries available to you:
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

The results of your correlation analysis provide interesting insights, particularly concerning the role of ventilation status. Here's some feedback:

1. **Correlation Analysis:**
   - The correlation between IL6 expression in monocytes and IL6R expression in T cells appears stronger in the ventilated group (r = 0.73) compared to the non-ventilated group (r = -0.20).
   - However, the p-value for the ventilated group is relatively high (p = 0.27), indicating that the correlation might not be statistically significant.

2. **Promising Directions:**
   - The positive trend in the ventilated group suggests a possible biological link worth exploring further. Although not statistically significant, system-level observations or additional data could reinforce this finding.
   - Consider verifying if there are potential confounding factors contributing to these correlations, such as differences in patient treatment regimens or stages of disease progression.

3. **Further Analysis Suggestions:**
   - **Increase Sample Size:** If possible, gather more data to strengthen the statistical power of your findings and potentially achieve significance.
   - **Investigate Other Cytokines or Receptors:** If IL6/IL6R does not provide statistically significant results, other cytokine-receptor pairs (e.g., TNF/TNFRSF1A) could reveal the dysregulated communication you hypothesized.
   - **Pathway Analysis:** Explore pathway enrichment analysis on differentially expressed genes between ventilated and non-ventilated samples, focusing on immune response and cytokine signaling pathways.
   - **Integration with Other Data:** Combine scRNA-seq data with other omics data (e.g., proteomics) for a comprehensive view of immune mechanisms affected by ventilation.

4. **Biological Validation:**
   - The hypothesis regarding enhanced communication between monocytes and T cells still requires more robust evidence before acceptance.
   - Consider experimental validation to corroborate transcriptomic data, such as flow cytometry to verify changes in protein expression levels of IL6 and IL6R.

Applying these recommendations could help clarify the role of monocyte-T cell interactions in severe COVID-19 and the impact of mechanical ventilation on these interactions.

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
Ventilation status may influence inflammatory signaling indirectly through baseline immune regulatory processes such as antigen presentation, as reflected by HLA1 expression. Thus, differences in HLA1 levels might confound or modulate the observed IL6/IL6R signaling between ventilated and non-ventilated COVID donors.

Analysis Plan:
['Merge donor-level median HLA1 expression (an immune regulatory marker) with the aggregated inflammatory ligand–receptor expression data and ventilation metadata; then, in COVID donors split by ventilation status, assess differences in HLA1 expression using a Mann–Whitney U test and examine its correlation with log-transformed IL6 expression in monocytes via scatter plots and Pearson correlation.']

Code for first step in analysis plan:
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from scipy.stats import mannwhitneyu, pearsonr

# Compute donor-level median HLA1 expression from all cells using adata.obs
# Note: We also retrieve Ventilated and Status metadata per donor

donor_hla = adata.obs[['Donor_full', 'HLA1', 'Ventilated', 'Status']].groupby('Donor_full').median().reset_index()

# For non-numeric metadata (Ventilated and Status), get the first observed value per donor
nd_meta = adata.obs[['Donor_full', 'Ventilated', 'Status']].drop_duplicates(subset='Donor_full')
donor_hla = pd.merge(donor_hla, nd_meta, on='Donor_full', how='left')

# Merge the donor-level HLA1 data with the aggregated inflammatory expression data (avg_expr)
expr_hla = pd.merge(avg_expr, donor_hla[['Donor_full', 'HLA1', 'Ventilated', 'Status']], on='Donor_full', how='left')

# Focus analysis on COVID donors and only the ventilation groups of interest: 'NonVent' and 'Vent'
expr_hla = expr_hla[expr_hla['Status'] == 'COVID']
expr_hla = expr_hla[expr_hla['Ventilated'].isin(['NonVent', 'Vent'])]

# Apply log1p normalization to IL6 expression in monocytes for robust correlation analysis
expr_hla['log_IL6_mono'] = np.log1p(expr_hla['IL6_mono'])

plt.figure(figsize=(6,5))
ax = sns.boxplot(data=expr_hla, x='Ventilated', y='HLA1', palette='Set2')
ax = sns.swarmplot(data=expr_hla, x='Ventilated', y='HLA1', color='0.25')
plt.title('Donor Median HLA1 Expression by Ventilation Status (COVID)')
plt.xlabel('Ventilation Status')
plt.ylabel('Median HLA1 Expression')
plt.show()

# Perform Mann–Whitney U test to compare HLA1 levels between Vent and NonVent COVID donors

    print(f"Mann–Whitney U test for HLA1: U = {u_stat}, p = {p_val:.3g}")

# Fit a linear regression line
m, b = np.polyfit(expr_hla['log_IL6_mono'], expr_hla['HLA1'], 1)
x_vals = np.linspace(expr_hla['log_IL6_mono'].min(), expr_hla['log_IL6_mono'].max(), 100)
y_vals = m * x_vals + b
plt.plot(x_vals, y_vals, color='red', label=f"Regression: y={m:.2f}x+{b:.2f}")
plt.xlabel('log1p(IL6 expression in monocytes)')
plt.ylabel('Median HLA1 Expression')
plt.title('Correlation between IL6 (Monocytes) and HLA1')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

# Compute Pearson correlation between log_IL6_mono and HLA1
if len(expr_hla) >= 3:
    r_value, p_corr = pearsonr(expr_hla['log_IL6_mono'], expr_hla['HLA1'])
    print(f"Pearson correlation between log_IL6_mono and HLA1: r = {r_value:.2f}, p = {p_corr:.3g}")
else:
    print("Insufficient data for Pearson correlation analysis.")

Feedback:
1. Analysis Plan Feedback:
 • The plan clearly defines the hypothesis and focuses on a novel angle (confounding effects of HLA1 on IL6/IL6R signaling) that is distinct from both the paper’s analyses and previous attempts.
 • Merging donor‐level median HLA1 with aggregated ligand–receptor data and metadata is logical. Consider briefly discussing how outliers in HLA1 will be managed and whether the median is the best summary.
 • The choice of tests (Mann–Whitney U and Pearson correlation) is appropriate given the assumed non-normality and exploratory goals; you might also consider noting whether Spearman correlation would be informative if data are not linear.
 • Overall, the plan is focused on the core hypothesis without branching into unrelated territory.

2. Code Feedback:
 • The code correctly computes donor-level medians for HLA1 while preserving non-numeric metadata by merging with a drop-duplicates frame.
 • The merging process with avg_expr is clear and appropriately subsets for COVID donors and the ventilation statuses of interest.
 • The log1p transformation applied to IL6 expression is well motivated; ensure that IL6_mono is always non-negative.
 • Visualization through boxplots with swarm overlays and the scatter plot with fitted regression line is well implemented; consider adding sample size annotations on the plots to enhance interpretability.
 • Statistical testing is appropriately guarded by checking minimally required sample sizes before running the Mann–Whitney U test and Pearson correlation.
 • The code adheres to the specified package restrictions and maintains consistency with previous analysis steps.
 
Overall, both the analysis plan and the code for this first step are clear, focused, and implement the intended approach with sound statistical and visualization methods.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /home/groups/jamesz/salber/CellVoyager/example/covid19.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never save them to a file.
    13. The analyses should be standard and should be analyses you think the paper missed.

Here is a summary of core single-cell analyses commonly done with the python libraries available to you:
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

The current analysis focuses on comparing the expression of specific inflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL1B, IL6) and their receptors (TNFRSF1A, IL1R1, IL6R) on monocytes and T cells between COVID-19 patients and healthy controls. Your results offer a preliminary overview of gene expression levels in these cell types across individual donors.

Promising Results:
1. There are discernible differences in expression levels of TNF, IL1B, and IL6 between COVID-19 and healthy donors in monocytes. Notably, IL1B is consistently higher in some COVID-19 donors (e.g., C7) compared to healthy controls. This differential expression might be indicative of enhanced inflammatory response in COVID-19.
2. T cells such as those expressing IL6R show variable expression in both COVID-19 (e.g., donor C6) and healthy controls, which might suggest individual variability in receptor expression.
3. The hypothesis around upregulated inflammatory signals is partially supported by the observed data, as some inflammatory markers are elevated in COVID-19 patients compared to controls.

Future Steps:
1. **Statistical Analysis:** Conduct statistical tests (e.g., Wilcoxon rank-sum test or Welch's t-test) to quantify the differences in gene expressions between COVID-19 patients and healthy controls. This can validate whether the expression differences observed are statistically significant.
2. **Phenotypic Correlation:** Integrate clinical metadata (e.g., severity of symptoms, presence of ARDS) to correlate gene expression patterns with clinical outcomes. This can enrich the biological relevance of your findings.
3. **Expand Receptor Analysis:** Further explore the receptor expression data (TNFRSF1A, IL1R1, IL6R) to assess the consistency of upregulation across more COVID-19 samples, especially those with more severe symptoms.
4. **Cell-Cell Interaction Analysis:** Utilize computational tools like CellPhoneDB or NicheNet to analyze potential ligand-receptor interactions and infer altered communication pathways between monocytes and T cells.
5. **Temporal Dynamics and Velocity Analysis:** Consider performing RNA velocity analysis to understand the temporal dynamics and trajectory of monocyte and T cell differentiation in response to infection, to gauge ongoing vs. stable response patterns.

Overall, the hypothesis regarding enhanced monocyte and T cell communication in COVID-19 patients is partially supported by increased cytokine and receptor expressions. Further analyses focusing on statistical validation, interaction pathways, and clinical integration will strengthen these observations and uncover mechanisms of immunopathology in severe COVID-19.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the enhanced monocyte–T cell ligand–receptor interactions observed in COVID‐19 are statistically robust and tightly associated with clinical ventilation status, and that these group-level differences are sufficiently captured by the previous analyses.

Analysis Plan:
[]

Code for first step in analysis plan:


Feedback:
Feedback on the First Step Code:
• The code is well organized and appropriately checks for the presence of required columns (e.g. “Status”) before proceeding.
• It correctly subsets cells into monocytes and T cells, verifies that the ligand and receptor genes exist in adata.var_names, and computes donor‐level averages. This aggregation is a sound foundation for downstream analyses.
• The conversion of sparse matrices to dense arrays is handled correctly using hasattr(…). Consider wrapping repeated subsetting and conversion steps into a helper function to avoid redundancy.
• Inline comments are clear, though adding brief comments on the biological rationale at key points (e.g. why using log1p transformation) could further aid interpretation.
• The code adheres to the allowed package guidelines and uses proper plotting and statistical testing methods.
• A minor suggestion is to ensure consistent variable naming and perhaps validate donor-level metadata (e.g. ventilation status) early to catch any inconsistencies.

Feedback on the Analysis Plan:
• The current analysis plan is empty. It should be filled with a clear, step‐by‐step description of how you will test the enhanced monocyte–T cell ligand–receptor interactions hypothesis in a novel way.
• Make sure to outline the novel aspects that distinguish your work from both the original paper and prior analyses (for example, incorporating additional cell type–specific analyses, new visualization strategies, or alternative statistical tests).
• It is important to clearly describe which additional computational methods will be applied (e.g. using alternative normalization, latent embedding with scvi, or advanced network analyses) so that each step is self-contained.
• Include details on how the planned analyses will integrate ventilation status and other clinical metadata and emphasize donor-level versus cell-level evaluation.
• Finally, ensure that the plan builds directly on the initial code, avoiding redundancy with the paper’s approaches while focusing on your central hypothesis.

Overall, the first step code is technically sound and appropriately builds the groundwork; however, your analysis plan should be expanded with specific, novel, and self-contained analyses that clearly justify each decision in light of the hypothesis.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /home/groups/jamesz/salber/CellVoyager/example/covid19.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never save them to a file.
    13. The analyses should be standard and should be analyses you think the paper missed.

Here is a summary of core single-cell analyses commonly done with the python libraries available to you:
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

The results provided show the aggregated expression levels of inflammatory cytokines in monocytes (TNF, IL1B, IL6) and their corresponding receptors in T cells (TNFRSF1A, IL1R1, IL6R) across different donors categorized into COVID-19 and Healthy groups. Here's the feedback:

1. **Promising Observations**:
   - The expression levels of TNF, IL1B, and IL6 in monocytes appear to be higher in some COVID-19 donors compared to healthy controls (e.g., C6 and C7 show relatively high expression).
   - Expression of IL6R in T cells seems notably higher in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls, which aligns with the hypothesis of enhanced monocyte-T cell communication via these inflammatory pathways.

2. **Focus on Variability**:
   - There is notable variability in cytokine and receptor expression levels among COVID-19 patients. This suggests heterogeneity within the patient group, possibly reflecting varying clinical manifestations or disease severities.
   - Consider stratifying the COVID-19 patients further based on clinical data (e.g., presence of ARDS, ventilation status) to pinpoint which subgroups exhibit the strongest dysregulated communication.

3. **Future Steps**:
   - **Statistical Validation**: Conduct statistical tests (e.g., Wilcoxon rank-sum test) to confirm whether observed differences between COVID-19 and Healthy groups are statistically significant.
   - **Correlational Studies**: Examine correlations between monocyte cytokine and T cell receptor expressions individually and collectively to explore potential co-regulation or dependency.
   - **Integration with Clinical Data**: Integrate clinical metadata to explore associations between expression levels and disease severity or outcomes. This can help understand if certain expression profiles correlate with worse outcomes.
   - **Explore Downstream Effects**: If enhanced signaling in COVID-19 patients is confirmed, extend the analysis to include downstream targets or pathways that might be activated as a result. This could involve pathway enrichment analyses or transcription factor activity profiling.

4. **Consideration for Novel Insights**:
   - Look for any potential novel signaling pathways or cellular interactions that diverge from those observed in the literature. This could involve re-examining less commonly studied ligand-receptor pairs or performing unbiased interaction mapping.
   - Focus on subsets of monocytes or T cells that may not have been fully characterized in the baseline analysis, such as intermediate monocyte populations or rare T cell subsets.

By following these steps, you can further test and potentially validate the hypothesis that enhanced cytokine signaling between monocytes and T cells plays a role in severe COVID-19 immunopathology.

PROMPT: Initial Analysis (user)

You will be provided a summary of a research paper as well as a set of computational analyses that were previously attempted for the given single-cell transcriptomic Andata dataset.
Your role is to provide a new computational analysis plan that is completely distinct from the analyses in the paper AND from those that were previously attempted.
Propose analyses that you think are missing from the paper. Ensure these are standard single-cell analyses.
Specifically, you will return a hypothesis, a series of analysis steps towards testing that hypothesis, and finally the python code for executing the first analysis step.

Ensure that your output is in the specified JSON format. For the code_description field, be very specific about what this particular code step does - mention the specific functions, data transformations, and computations being performed.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /home/groups/jamesz/salber/CellVoyager/example/covid19.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never save them to a file.
    13. The analyses should be standard and should be analyses you think the paper missed.

Here is a summary of core single-cell analyses commonly done with the python libraries available to you:
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.



For the analysis plan, think of the analysis plan as a scientific workflow:
    1. Start with exploratory data analysis that is broad and tests many things
    2. Then, focus on the more promising results from the exploratory phase by creating more focused analyses
    3. Include statistical validation of your results where appropiate
Do not number the analysis plan.
Each step in the analysis plan should be distinct from one another and could involve loading the data, conducting a statistical analysis, printing information about the AnnData object, etc.
Use however many steps is appropiate, but go for at least 5 steps.

Here are the previous analyses attempted:
In severe COVID‐19, the average expression levels of key inflammatory ligands (e.g., TNF, IL1B, IL6) in monocytes positively correlate with the average expression levels of their corresponding receptors (e.g., TNFRSF1A, IL1R1, IL6R) in T cells, suggesting enhanced ligand‐receptor interplay that may contribute to immunopathology.


Here is a summary of the research paper:
Biological background  
The paper focuses on severe COVID-19, a condition induced by SARS‑CoV‑2 infection that, in a subset of patients, progresses to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring intensive care. Given the high morbidity and mortality associated with severe disease, understanding the underlying immune responses is crucial. The study investigates how the peripheral immune compartment, particularly within the blood, responds during severe COVID-19 and the potential mechanisms that could both drive immunopathology and contribute to protective immunity.

Biological background  
Key biological questions addressed include how different immune cell subsets are reconfigured during severe COVID-19, the role of specific cells in processes like cytokine release syndrome, and whether peripheral immune cells contribute to the cytokine storm widely feared in these patients. The authors also evaluate the extent of interferon-driven gene expression and the dysregulation of antigen presentation molecules (e.g. HLA class II), alongside the emergence of unusual cell populations such as developing neutrophils, to provide a comprehensive view of the immune alterations in severe cases.

Paper’s computational analyses  
The first computational workflow involved processing Seq-Well scRNA‑seq data from 44,721 cells isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients and controls. Using the Seurat package, the authors performed data scaling, transformation, and variable gene identification via SCTransform(). Dimensionality reduction through PCA followed by UMAP embedding and graph‑based clustering (using the Louvain method) resulted in the identification of 30 clusters corresponding to diverse immune cell types. Differential expression (DE) analysis using the Wilcoxon rank‑sum test allowed manual annotation of these clusters according to known immune markers. This preliminary analysis revealed significant phenotypic differences between COVID‑19 patients and healthy individuals, particularly among monocytes, T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells.

Paper’s computational analyses  
A series of focused analyses on cell type proportions was then conducted; the authors quantified changes in immune cell subset frequencies between COVID‑19 and control samples. They found that several innate immune subsets—including γδ T cells, plasmacytoid and conventional dendritic cells, CD16+ monocytes, and some NK cell populations—were substantially depleted, especially in patients with ARDS. Conversely, plasmablast proportions were increased, particularly in more severe cases, suggesting a robust humoral response. In addition, a novel “developing neutrophil” population was identified that expressed neutrophil granule protein genes (e.g., ELANE, LTF, MMP8) but lacked canonical neutrophil surface markers, hinting at a differentiation continuum potentially linked to emergency granulopoiesis.

Paper’s computational analyses  
The authors then performed in-depth analyses on specific immune compartments. For monocytes, UMAP‐based subclustering distinguished CD14+ and CD16+ subsets, revealing a strong phenotypic shift where CD14+ monocytes dominated while CD16+ were depleted. DE analysis in monocytes indicated little to no expression of pro‑inflammatory cytokine genes such as TNF, IL6, or IL1B, opposing the notion that peripheral monocytes drive the cytokine storm. Instead, a remarkable downregulation of HLA class II genes was noted—more pronounced in ventilated patients—and an interferon‑stimulated gene (ISG) signature was variably present, with regulatory analysis suggesting differential IFN and IRF activity across patients. In parallel, analyses of T and NK cells via UMAP identified distinct populations (CD4+ T, CD8+ T and NK cells) with further DE and pathway‐enrichment analyses showing depletion of specific NK subsets (CD56dim, CD56bright) and an inconclusive evidence of T cell exhaustion. Additionally, a focused RNA velocity analysis on plasmablasts and developing neutrophils revealed a differentiation bridge: cells transitioned from an Ig gene‑expressing plasmablast state to progressively express neutrophil granule proteins, with transcription factors (CEBPE and CEBPD) marking this continuum. This trajectory analysis suggests potential cellular transdifferentiation events in severe COVID‑19 with ARDS.

Paper’s dataset description  
The dataset comprises single‑cell transcriptomic data obtained from 44,721 cells derived from eight peripheral blood samples collected from seven hospitalized COVID‑19 patients (ranging in age and clinical presentation, including patients with and without ARDS) as well as six healthy control donors. Each sample includes detailed metadata such as donor demographics, time post–symptom onset, ventilation status, and treatment history (e.g., administration of azithromycin or remdesivir), which provides context to the observed cellular phenotypes. In addition to high‑quality scRNA‑seq measurements (including UMIs, gene counts, and quality metrics like mitochondrial and rRNA read percentages), the dataset incorporates downstream DE gene lists, pathway enrichment analyses, upstream regulator predictions, and RNA velocity trajectories. Together, this intricate dataset connects transcriptional dynamics of peripheral immune cells to the pathogenesis and progression of severe COVID‑19, offering a rich resource for dissecting disease immunology and guiding therapeutic strategies.
In severe COVID‐19 patients, dysregulated cell–cell communication mediated by key inflammatory ligand–receptor pairs drives altered interactions between specific immune cell types. In particular, we hypothesize that interactions between monocytes (as major producers of inflammatory ligands) and T cells (as recipients via corresponding receptors) are enhanced in severe COVID‐19 compared to healthy controls. Detecting such changes may help identify communication pathways that contribute to immunopathology.
In severe COVID‐19 patients, we hypothesize that monocytes upregulate inflammatory ligands (e.g., TNF, IL1B, IL6) and T cells simultaneously increase expression of the corresponding receptors (e.g., TNFRSF1A, IL1R1, IL6R). This enhanced expression is expected to boost the communication signaling between monocytes and T cells compared to healthy controls. Such dysregulated communication may contribute to immunopathology in severe COVID‐19.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: initial_analysis

Hypothesis: T cells in severe COVID‐19 patients display increased heterogeneity in interferon (IFN) response activation compared to healthy controls, suggesting dysregulated IFN signaling contributes to immune pathology.

Analysis Plan:
1. Subset the data to focus on T cell populations (e.g., CD4 T, CD8 T, and gd T cells) as they are central to antiviral responses.
2. Define a curated interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) signature (e.g., ISG15, IFIT1, IFIT3, MX1, OAS1, RSAD2) and compute an IFN response score using Scanpy's score_genes function.
3. Perform statistical comparisons (Mann-Whitney U test) of the IFN score between COVID and healthy groups for each T cell subtype to assess whether there is a significant difference in activation levels.
4. Visualize the distribution of IFN scores using violin plots for each T cell group, stratified by disease status, to capture trends and heterogeneity in response.
5. Summarize and print the statistical results to evaluate the hypothesis of enhanced and heterogeneous IFN responses in COVID-19 T cells.

Initial Code:
import scanpy as sc
import anndata

# Subset adata to include only T cells: CD4 T, CD8 T, and gd T
t_cell_types = ['CD4 T', 'CD8 T', 'gd T']
adata_tcells = adata[adata.obs['cell_type_coarse'].isin(t_cell_types)].copy()

# Define a curated interferon-stimulated gene signature
ifn_signature_genes = ['ISG15', 'IFIT1', 'IFIT3', 'MX1', 'OAS1', 'RSAD2']

# Compute an IFN response score for T cells using the designated gene list
sc.tl.score_genes(adata_tcells, gene_list=ifn_signature_genes, score_name='ifn_score', use_raw=False)

# Plot a violin plot of the IFN score, grouped by disease Status (COVID vs Healthy)
sc.pl.violin(adata_tcells, keys='ifn_score', groupby='Status', stripplot=True, jitter=0.4, size=2)

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
T cells in severe COVID‐19 patients display increased heterogeneity in interferon (IFN) response activation compared to healthy controls, suggesting dysregulated IFN signaling contributes to immune pathology.

Analysis Plan:
['Subset the data to focus on T cell populations (e.g., CD4 T, CD8 T, and gd T cells) as they are central to antiviral responses.', "Define a curated interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) signature (e.g., ISG15, IFIT1, IFIT3, MX1, OAS1, RSAD2) and compute an IFN response score using Scanpy's score_genes function.", 'Perform statistical comparisons (Mann-Whitney U test) of the IFN score between COVID and healthy groups for each T cell subtype to assess whether there is a significant difference in activation levels.', 'Visualize the distribution of IFN scores using violin plots for each T cell group, stratified by disease status, to capture trends and heterogeneity in response.', 'Summarize and print the statistical results to evaluate the hypothesis of enhanced and heterogeneous IFN responses in COVID-19 T cells.']

# Subset adata to include only T cells: CD4 T, CD8 T, and gd T
t_cell_types = ['CD4 T', 'CD8 T', 'gd T']

sc.pl.violin(adata_tcells, keys='ifn_score', groupby='Status', stripplot=True, jitter=0.4, size=2)

Feedback:
Feedback on the First-Step Code:
• The code is clear and adheres to the allowed packages and guidelines. It correctly subsets T cells and computes an IFN score with a curated gene list.
• Consider adding a couple of safety checks (e.g., verifying that the “cell_type_coarse” and “Status” columns exist) to avoid potential runtime issues.
• Adding inline comments noting why use_raw=False is chosen could improve clarity, especially for users unfamiliar with the computation nuances.
• The violin plot call is effective but ensuring that the plot’s axes labels and title are informative could help in downstream presentations.

Feedback on the Analysis Plan:
• The plan is concise and aligned with the hypothesis of IFN response heterogeneity in COVID-19 T cells. It clearly outlines data subsetting, scoring, statistical comparisons, and visualization.
• It would be beneficial to explicitly analyze each T cell subtype (CD4, CD8, gd T) separately, rather than aggregating them, to capture subtype-specific differences in IFN signaling.
• To build on novelty, consider incorporating additional computational metrics to quantify heterogeneity (e.g., variance, coefficient of variation) across cell subtypes.
• Ensure that downstream steps include the appropriate statistical testing (Mann-Whitney U test) with reporting of p-values and effect sizes, following the guidelines.
• Finally, explicitly noting the integration of metadata from adata.obs (e.g., stratifying plots by Status) emphasizes the self-contained nature of the analysis per the guidelines.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /home/groups/jamesz/salber/CellVoyager/example/covid19.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never save them to a file.
    13. The analyses should be standard and should be analyses you think the paper missed.

Here is a summary of core single-cell analyses commonly done with the python libraries available to you:
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: revised_analysis

Revised Hypothesis: T cells in severe COVID‐19 patients display increased heterogeneity in interferon (IFN) response activation compared to healthy controls, suggesting dysregulated IFN signaling contributes to immune pathology.

Revised Analysis Plan:
1. Verify that the necessary metadata columns (e.g., 'cell_type_coarse' and 'Status') are present in adata.obs to prevent runtime errors.
2. Subset the data to focus on T cell populations (CD4 T, CD8 T, and gd T cells) ensuring that each T cell subtype is analyzed separately to capture subtype-specific IFN response differences.
3. Define a curated interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) signature and compute an IFN response score for each T cell using Scanpy's score_genes function, explicitly setting use_raw=False with a comment on raw data handling.
4. Visualize the distribution of IFN scores using enhanced violin plots with informative axes labels and titles, stratified by disease Status (COVID vs Healthy) for each T cell subtype.
5. Perform statistical comparisons (Mann-Whitney U test) of the IFN score between COVID and healthy groups per T cell subtype and compute additional metrics (variance, coefficient of variation) to quantify heterogeneity.
6. Summarize and report the statistical tests (p-values and effect sizes) to evaluate the hypothesis regarding enhanced and heterogeneous IFN responses in COVID-19 T cells.

Revised Code:

required_columns = ['cell_type_coarse', 'Status']

    if col not in adata.obs.columns:

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

The current analysis focuses on the IFN score in T cells between COVID-19 patients and healthy controls. The results show a notable increase in the IFN response score for COVID-19 patients compared to healthy individuals. This is consistent with the understanding that interferon-driven responses play a role in inflammatory cascades seen in severe COVID-19.

**Feedback:**

1. **Promising Results:**
   - The elevated IFN score in COVID-19 patients suggests heightened interferon responses, which might be linked to immune dysregulation observed in severe cases.
   - These findings align with the paper’s focus on interferon-stimulated gene expression and dysregulated immune responses.

2. **Further Exploration:**
   - **Cell-Type Specific Analysis:** Investigate IFN scores across different T cell subtypes (e.g., CD4+, CD8+, regulatory T cells) to assess whether certain subsets are driving these responses.
   - **Cluster Analysis**: Explore clustering of high IFN-scoring cells to see if they correlate with specific clinical features or disease severity.
   - **Longitudinal Analysis:** Examine how IFN scores evolve over the course of the disease and in response to specific treatments.

3. **Integration with Hypotheses:**
   - **Ligand-Receptor Interactions:** Verify if there is simultaneous upregulation of IFN-related receptors on T cells, supporting the hypothesis of enhanced monocyte-T cell communication.
   - **Compare with Other Cytokines:** Examine the correlation between IFN scores and expression of other inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF, IL6).

By pursuing these directions, you can deepen the understanding of interferon’s role in severe COVID-19 and its contribution to immunopathology.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
Distinct T cell subpopulations, identifiable via unsupervised clustering, exhibit varied interferon responses that correlate with COVID‐19 status, suggesting that certain clusters may drive the heightened IFN signal observed in patients.

Analysis Plan:
['Perform PCA-based dimensionality reduction on the existing T cell subset to prepare the data for clustering.', 'Construct a k-nearest-neighbor graph, run UMAP for visualization, and then apply Leiden clustering to partition T cells into subpopulations.', 'Overlay the IFN response score on the UMAP embedding to visually identify clusters with elevated IFN responses.', 'Generate violin plots to compare IFN score distributions across clusters and between COVID and healthy groups, incorporating statistical comparisons.', 'Interpret the identified clusters for potential novel insights into T cell subset contributions to severe COVID-19 immunopathology.']

Code for first step in analysis plan:
import scanpy as sc
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Assuming adata_tcells from the previous step contains T cells with computed IFN score

# Step 1: Scale the data and perform PCA for dimensionality reduction
sc.pp.scale(adata_tcells)
sc.tl.pca(adata_tcells, svd_solver='arpack')

# Step 2: Compute the nearest neighbor graph and generate UMAP embeddings
sc.pp.neighbors(adata_tcells, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30)
sc.tl.umap(adata_tcells)

# Step 3: Apply Leiden clustering to partition T cells into subpopulations
sc.tl.leiden(adata_tcells, resolution=0.8, key_added='leiden_clusters')

# Step 4: Plot UMAP embedding colored by Leiden clusters
sc.pl.umap(adata_tcells, color='leiden_clusters', title='UMAP of T cells by Leiden Clusters', show=False)

# Step 5: Plot UMAP embedding colored by IFN score for overlaying expression patterns
sc.pl.umap(adata_tcells, color='ifn_score', title='UMAP of T cells with IFN Score', show=False)

plt.show()

# Step 6: Use seaborn to visualize IFN score distribution across clusters and by disease status
plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
sns.violinplot(data=adata_tcells.obs, x='leiden_clusters', y='ifn_score', hue='Status', split=True)
plt.title('Distribution of IFN Score across T cell Clusters by Disease Status')
plt.xlabel('Leiden Cluster')
plt.ylabel('IFN Score')
plt.legend(title='Status')
plt.show()

Feedback:
• The code is organized and logically implements the first analysis step: scaling, PCA, neighbor graph construction, UMAP embedding, Leiden clustering, and visualization overlays. It follows the guidelines to build on previous analyses without repeating them.

• Consider adding a note on why specific parameters (e.g., n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30, resolution=0.8) were chosen and whether sensitivity analyses might be needed to validate different clustering granularity.

• While the UMAP and violin plots appropriately visualize IFN score patterns across clusters and statuses, incorporating a statistical test (e.g., a t-test or Mann–Whitney U test) to formally compare IFN scores between groups would strengthen the analysis, as specified in the guidelines.

• Ensure that the code leverages only in-memory data (adata and adata_tcells), and confirm that the IFN score column (‘ifn_score’) is computed and available in adata_tcells from the prior steps.

• The analysis plan itself is concise and distinct from previous work. It focuses on sub-clustering T cells and then overlaying the IFN response signature, which is a novel angle relative to the paper’s approach. Just ensure that later steps also include clear statistical comparisons and grid displays if multiple figures are to be shown together.

• Overall, the code adheres to the allowed package usage and coding guidelines, but adding explicit statistical testing and parameter justifications would further enhance the robustness of the analysis.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /home/groups/jamesz/salber/CellVoyager/example/covid19.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never save them to a file.
    13. The analyses should be standard and should be analyses you think the paper missed.

Here is a summary of core single-cell analyses commonly done with the python libraries available to you:
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: results_interpretation

The current analysis highlights several key findings and considerations:

1. **Clustering Analysis**: The UMAP visualization showing 14 distinct clusters of T cells is promising for further characterization of T cell subpopulations in COVID-19. This differentiation could help identify specific T cell subsets affected in severe COVID-19 and reveal potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

2. **IFN Score Analysis**: The significant Mann–Whitney U test indicating a difference in the IFN score between COVID-19 and healthy T cells suggests notable divergence in their activation and functional state, potentially linked to disease pathology. Further exploration into specific clusters with high IFN scores, particularly in clusters exhibiting notable differences between COVID-19 and healthy samples, could provide insights into the contribution of these cells to pathogenesis.

3. **Cluster-Specific Analysis**: The violin plot of the IFN score across clusters shows heterogeneity in IFN-driven activity within the T cell populations. It would be informative to analyze whether specific clusters correspond to known T cell phenotypes that are enriched in either COVID-19 or healthy samples.

4. **Distinct from Prior Analyses**: Unlike the prior analysis or the study, your focus on IFN scores across all T cell clusters and its association with disease status might reveal new facets of immune dysregulation that are distinct from the inflammatory ligand-receptor interactions previously assessed.

5. **Future Steps**:
   - Conduct differential expression analysis to identify key genes and pathways that are differentially expressed in T cells with high vs. low IFN scores in COVID-19.
   - Extend the IFN score analysis to coincide with ligand-receptor expression data to validate or refute the hypothesis of dysregulated communication pathways.
   - Perform trajectory or pseudotime analysis on the identified T cell clusters to investigate potential cellular state transitions or maturation pathways enhanced in COVID-19.
   - Consider integrating additional metadata like symptom onset and treatment history to correlate IFN scores with clinical outcomes or patient stratification.

By pursuing these analyses, you will contribute novel insights into the role of T cells in severe COVID-19, potentially identifying unique therapeutic targets.

PROMPT: Incorporate Critiques (user)

You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
You will also be given feedback for these components. Your role is to incorporate that feedback and update these components.

Analysis Hypothesis:
Within severe COVID-19 T cells, the transcriptional profiles of cells with high IFN response diverge significantly from those with low IFN response, potentially revealing novel regulatory genes and pathways that drive the observed heterogeneity.

Analysis Plan:
["Subset COVID-19 T cells and stratify them into 'High' and 'Low' IFN response groups based on the median IFN score.", "Perform differential expression analysis comparing high versus low IFN groups using Scanpy's rank_genes_groups function.", 'Visualize the top differentially expressed genes using heatmaps and dot plots to highlight key markers.', 'Optionally, explore pseudotime ordering along the IFN gradient to capture dynamic changes in T cell states.']

Code for first step in analysis plan:
import scanpy as sc
import numpy as np

# Subset only COVID-19 T cells from the previously processed adata_tcells
covid_tcells = adata_tcells[adata_tcells.obs['Status'] == 'COVID'].copy()

# Stratify cells into 'High' and 'Low' IFN response groups using the median IFN score
median_ifn = np.median(covid_tcells.obs['ifn_score'])
covid_tcells.obs['IFN_group'] = ['High' if score > median_ifn else 'Low' for score in covid_tcells.obs['ifn_score']]

# Perform differential expression analysis between High and Low IFN groups using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test
sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(covid_tcells, groupby='IFN_group', groups=['High'], reference='Low', method='wilcoxon')

# Print the top 5 differentially expressed gene names for the High IFN group
top_genes = covid_tcells.uns['rank_genes_groups']['names']
print('Top differentially expressed genes in High IFN group:')
print(top_genes[:5])

Feedback:
• Analysis Plan Feedback:
  – The hypothesis is clearly defined and the plan is focused on distinguishing IFN response within COVID‐19 T cells. It is distinct from prior analyses that focus on differential cell–cell communication and broad immune cell profiling.
  – The stratification by the median IFN score is a straightforward choice, but consider testing alternative thresholds (e.g., quartiles) or verifying the distribution of ifn_score to ensure the median is optimal.
  – To further support the hypothesis, adding subsequent visualization steps (heatmaps/dot plots) to depict differential gene expression would enhance interpretability.
  – Including statistical significance measures (e.g., adjusted p‐values) in the figure annotations could improve the robustness of downstream interpretations.

• Code Feedback:
  – The COVID‐19 T cell subset filtering and IFN score stratification are appropriately implemented. However, using a vectorized method (e.g., np.where) for assigning “High” and “Low” labels could increase efficiency: e.g., covid_tcells.obs['IFN_group'] = np.where(covid_tcells.obs['ifn_score'] > median_ifn, 'High', 'Low').
  – When performing differential expression analysis with sc.tl.rank_genes_groups, ensure that the uns dictionary is accessed correctly. Typically, the top genes for group “High” are stored under covid_tcells.uns['rank_genes_groups']['names']['High'], so adjust the print statement accordingly.
  – Consider printing associated statistical metrics (p-values, log-fold changes) alongside gene names to provide a more comprehensive output.
  – The code follows the allowed package guidelines and integrates well with previous analyses.
  – Adding inline comments to highlight key logic steps (e.g., rationale for median threshold) is good; ensure these remain concise and informative.

Overall, the plan and initial implementation are solid and distinct from previous workflows, with room for additional robustness in statistical reporting and visualization.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /home/groups/jamesz/salber/CellVoyager/example/covid19.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never save them to a file.
    13. The analyses should be standard and should be analyses you think the paper missed.

Here is a summary of core single-cell analyses commonly done with the python libraries available to you:
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

Here is the code from the last 3 steps. Make sure the modified code builds on the past analyses and doesn't repeat any of them:

# Ensure warnings are suppressed for a cleaner output

# Step 1: Scale the data and perform PCA for dimensionality reduction
# PCA is used here to capture the most significant variance; 'arpack' solver is chosen for its efficiency.
sc.pp.scale(adata_tcells)
sc.tl.pca(adata_tcells, svd_solver='arpack')

# Step 2: Build the k-nearest-neighbor graph and generate UMAP embeddings
# n_neighbors=15 and n_pcs=30 are selected to balance local and global structures; sensitivity analyses can adjust these parameters if needed.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: next_step

Next step: Subset COVID-19 T cells and stratify them into 'High' and 'Low' IFN response groups using the median IFN score; consider alternative thresholds (e.g., quartiles) if the distribution suggests a more robust separation.

Code:
```python
import scanpy as sc
import numpy as np

# Subset only COVID-19 T cells from the previously processed adata_tcells
covid_tcells = adata_tcells[adata_tcells.obs['Status'] == 'COVID'].copy()

# Calculate the median IFN score to stratify cells
median_ifn = np.median(covid_tcells.obs['ifn_score'])

# Stratify cells into 'High' and 'Low' IFN response groups using a vectorized approach
covid_tcells.obs['IFN_group'] = np.where(covid_tcells.obs['ifn_score'] > median_ifn, 'High', 'Low')

# Perform differential expression analysis between High and Low IFN groups using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test
sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(covid_tcells, groupby='IFN_group', groups=['High'], reference='Low', method='wilcoxon')

# Retrieve results from the differential expression analysis
de_results = covid_tcells.uns['rank_genes_groups']
high_genes = de_results['names']['High']
pvals = de_results['pvals']['High']
logfc = de_results['logfoldchanges']['High']

# Print the top 5 differentially expressed genes along with p-values and log-fold changes
print('Top differentially expressed genes in High IFN group:')
for i in range(5):
    print(f"Gene: {high_genes[i]}, p-value: {pvals[i]:.3g}, log-fold change: {logfc[i]:.3g}")

```
