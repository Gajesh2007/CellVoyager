You will be given a hypothesis, analysis plan, and the python code for the first step in that analysis plan.
This analysis plan is for generating a novel single-cell transcriptomic analysis that is distinct from the analyses
conducted in the research paper below and distinct from the previous analyses attempted.

Your role is to provide feedback for the first step python code as well as for the analysis plan.
Ensure that the code following the coding guidelines below as well.
Only return the feedback, nothing else. Keep the feedback thorough but concise. 

Analysis Hypothesis:
{hypothesis}

Analysis Plan:
{analysis_plan}

Code for first step in analysis plan:
{first_step_code}

{CODING_GUIDELINES}

You are given the following summary of the anndata object:
