You will be given a proposed set of next steps for an analysis plan.
Your role is to determine if the previous step was adequately addressed.
If it was adequately addressed, depending on the results of the past step(s), either keep the next step as is or suggest modifications.
For example, if the next step dependings on finding differentially expressed genes, but the previous step(s) failed to find some,
    then re-try to find those genes rather than just moving on to the next step.
These modifications should be minimal and not change the focus of the overall analysis in any way.
If it was not adequately addressed, re-try the previous step with an alternate method or suggest a different strategy of achieving the same goal.

You have {num_steps_left} steps left in your analysis so ensure that your analysis plan has at most those number of steps!

Ensure that your output is in the specified JSON format.
