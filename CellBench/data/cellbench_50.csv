"Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a significant global health issue, ranking as the 16th most common malignancy worldwide with high mortality. Specifically, OSCC of the gingivo-buccal region (OSCC-GB) is the most prevalent cancer among men in India and sixth among women. OSCC-GB is strongly associated with tobacco chewing habits, often presents at advanced stages (III/IV), and has a high rate of loco-regional failure, contributing to a poor prognosis. Like many cancers, OSCC displays considerable cellular heterogeneity, encompassing diverse cell types with distinct genomic, epigenomic, and phenotypic features within the tumor microenvironment. This heterogeneity is considered a key factor influencing tumor progression, response to treatment, treatment failure/recurrence, and patient survival. While recent single-cell transcriptomic studies have explored heterogeneity in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), particularly focusing on tongue cancer or comparing HPV-positive and HPV-negative cases, the specific intratumor cellular heterogeneity of OSCC-GB remains largely uncharacterized. Previous bulk sequencing studies indicated notable differences in gene expression profiles between tongue cancer and OSCC-GB. Furthermore, some OSCC-GB cases arise in conjunction with a precancerous lesion known as oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF), but the cellular features specific to these tumors are not well understood. This study aims to use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to characterize the landscape of cellular diversity and identify novel aspects of heterogeneity in cell types and cell states within OSCC-GB tumors, including those with concomitant OSMF.","['Identification of Malignant Epithelial Cells', 'Overall Cell Type Classification and Annotation', 'Analysis of Malignant Cell Heterogeneity and OSMF Association', 'Identification of Cellular Programs in Malignant Cells (pEMT, Fetal/Germ-like)', 'Pseudotime Trajectory Analysis of Malignant Cells', 'Analysis of Immune-Related Gene Expression in Malignant Cells', 'Subclustering and Characterization of T Cells', 'Pseudotime Trajectory Analysis of T Cells', 'Subclustering and Characterization of B Cells', 'Subclustering and Characterization of Myeloid Cells', 'Pseudotime Trajectory Analysis of Macrophages', 'Subclustering and Characterization of Endothelial Cells', 'Subclustering and Characterization of Fibroblasts', 'Pseudotime Trajectory Analysis of Fibroblasts', 'Analysis of Driver Gene Co-expression Patterns', 'Comparison with Bulk RNA-seq Data']","[{'title': 'Identification of Malignant Epithelial Cells', 'description': 'Malignant cells were identified from the epithelial cell population using two methods.

"The placenta serves as a crucial maternal-fetal barrier during pregnancy, facilitating nutrient exchange while providing protection against infections. However, certain pathogens, including the parasites *Plasmodium falciparum* (causative agent of malaria), *Toxoplasma gondii* (causative agent of toxoplasmosis), and the bacterium *Listeria monocytogenes* (causative agent of listeriosis), can breach or compromise this barrier. Infections by these pathogens during early pregnancy are particularly dangerous, potentially leading to severe complications such as miscarriage, premature labor, low birth weight, stillbirth, and long-term developmental anomalies in the child. The placenta employs innate immune defenses to counter infections. Trophoblasts, the epithelial-like cells forming the outer layers (syncytiotrophoblast - SCT, and underlying villous cytotrophoblast - VCT), constitute a primary physical and immunological barrier. Within the placental stroma, fetal macrophages known as Hofbauer cells (HBCs) represent the main resident immune cell population in a healthy first-trimester placenta. While HBCs are known to have roles in tissue remodeling and angiogenesis, and possess some antimicrobial capabilities, their specific functions during diverse pathogen encounters remain poorly characterized. Studying these interactions directly in humans is challenging. Mouse models have limitations due to significant differences in placental structure and HBC origin compared to humans. Recent advances include human trophoblast stem cells, organoids, and placental explant cultures. Explant cultures, which preserve the complex multi-lineage architecture of the placenta including trophoblasts, stromal cells, endothelial cells, and Hofbauer cells, offer a valuable model. Previous studies using explants often relied on bulk analysis methods, which obscure cell-type-specific responses and interactions. This paper utilizes an optimized human placental explant model from early pregnancy (5-14 post-conceptional weeks) exposed to *P. falciparum*, *T. gondii*, and *L. monocytogenes* to investigate the acute cellular responses at a high resolution.","['Single-cell and single-nuclei RNA-seq data processing and quality control', 'Cell type annotation of placental cells', 'Integration of single-cell datasets', 'Differential gene expression analysis across conditions and cell types', 'Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis', 'Cell-cell communication inference', 'Analysis of pathogen transcriptomes from scRNA-seq data', 'Benchmarking of explant model against in vivo placental atlas', 'Analysis of cell hashing data']","[{'title': 'Single-cell and single-nuclei RNA-seq data processing and quality control', 'description': ""Raw sequencing data from 10x Genomics single-cell (scRNA-seq) and single-nuclei (snRNA-seq) experiments were aligned and quantified.

"Mammalian kidney development is a complex process involving crosstalk between the metanephric mesenchyme (MM) and the ureteric bud (UB). The UB invades the MM and undergoes branching morphogenesis, while the cap mesenchyme (CM) surrounding the UB tips contains nephron progenitor cells (NPCs). NPCs self-renew and differentiate, undergoing mesenchymal-epithelial transition through intermediate structures (pretubular aggregate [PTA], renal vesicle [RV], comma-shaped body [CSB], and s-shaped body [SSB]) to form the nephron epithelium. The collecting duct system originates from the UB. Stromal cells (interstitial cells, mesangial cells, etc.) arise from interstitial progenitors, while endothelial cells form the vasculature, and leukocytes enter via blood. Current understanding relies heavily on mouse models, but significant morphological and gene expression differences exist between mouse and human renal embryogenesis. This divergence, coupled with a scarcity of detailed gene expression data for human kidney development, hinders a thorough understanding of human nephrogenesis and the potential developmental origins of kidney diseases. Regenerative medicine approaches for kidney disease require detailed knowledge of human kidney development, which is currently lacking compared to mouse models.

"Autologous anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy is a highly effective treatment for patients with relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma (rrLBCL), significantly improving patient outcomes. However, this therapy is associated with various toxicities that can delay patient recovery. While the biological mechanisms of early-onset toxicities such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune-effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) have been investigated, the pathophysiology of longer-term toxicities like prolonged cytopenia (PC) is poorly understood. PC is defined as grade ≥3 cytopenia (encompassing anemia, neutropenia, or thrombocytopenia) that persists beyond 30 days after CAR T-cell infusion. It affects approximately 30% of patients, and its occurrence and duration often exceed what would be expected from the lymphodepleting chemotherapy (e.g., fludarabine and cyclophosphamide) used as conditioning, suggesting mechanisms beyond conditioning-induced myelosuppression. PC can persist for several months to years, leading to significant clinical challenges, including the need for frequent blood transfusions, hospitalizations due to infections, and limitations in administering subsequent anti-cancer treatments if the lymphoma progresses. Therefore, identifying the underlying mechanisms of PC and developing targeted therapeutic strategies is a critical unmet need for improving the long-term outcomes of CAR T-cell therapy recipients. It is known from broader hematology research that cytokines like interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) can play a role in regulating hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) functions, including self-renewal and differentiation, and dysregulation of such pathways can lead to bone marrow dysfunction.","['Construction of a single-cell atlas of bone marrow and comparison between rrLBCL patients and healthy donors', 'Identification of differentially abundant bone marrow cell populations in CAR T patients with prolonged cytopenia (PC)', 'Single-cell pathway analysis comparing bone marrow cells from CAR T patients with and without prolonged cytopenia (PC)', 'Characterization of IFN-γ response signatures in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from CAR T patients with prolonged cytopenia (PC)', 'Quantification and source identification of IFNG expression in the bone marrow of CAR T patients with prolonged cytopenia (PC)', 'In-depth sub-clustering and characterization of bone marrow CD8 T cells', 'Identification of differentially abundant CD8 T cell subsets in CAR T patients with prolonged cytopenia (PC)', 'Analysis of T cell receptor (TCR) clonal expansion within CD8 T cell subsets from CAR T patients with prolonged cytopenia (PC)', 'Search for public TCR motifs in expanded CD8 T cell clonotypes from patients with prolonged cytopenia (PC)', 'Screening for T-LGL-associated STAT3 mutations in bone marrow CD8 T cells', 'Comparative expression analysis of IFNG and TBX21 in CD8 T cell subsets from CAR T patients with and without prolonged cytopenia (PC)', 'Assessment of CAR construct expression in bone marrow CD8 T cells post-infusion', 'Re-analysis of CAR T cell infusion products to identify pre-infusion correlates of prolonged cytopenia (PC)']","[{'title': 'Construction of a single-cell atlas of bone marrow and comparison between rrLBCL patients and healthy donors', 'description': ""Bone marrow mononuclear cells (92,676 cells post-QC) from 22 individuals, including 16 rrLBCL patients post-CAR T therapy (11 with prolonged cytopenia (PC), 5 without PC, though 2 PC samples were later excluded from comparative analyses due to AML/LBCL involvement, resulting in 9 PC and 5 no PC for those comparisons), 5 healthy donors, and 1 rrLBCL patient with chemotherapy-associated cytopenia (control), were processed using 10x Genomics 5'GEX with paired T cell receptor (TCR) and B cell receptor (BCR) sequencing.

"Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic gastrointestinal disease with increasing global prevalence, representing a significant healthcare burden. It is understood to be a multifactorial condition, arising from a complex interplay of genetic predispositions, immune system dysregulation, and environmental factors. CD, along with ulcerative colitis (UC), falls under the umbrella of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), which are characterized by immune-mediated, relapsing-remitting chronic inflammation of the gut. While both CD and UC involve a dysfunctional and hyperactive immune response, they differ in their presentation: CD inflammation can affect all layers of the gut and may occur discontinuously throughout the intestinal tract, whereas UC inflammation is typically limited to the colonic epithelium. CD predominantly affects the terminal ileum (TI) and colon (CO), and emerging evidence suggests that ileal-dominant and colonic CD might represent distinct disease subtypes, underscoring the importance of understanding site-specific cellular and molecular mechanisms. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and exome sequencing have identified numerous risk genes for IBD, implicating pathways related to epithelial barrier function, microbial sensing, and adaptive immunity. The intestinal environment itself is a complex ecosystem involving intricate interactions between diverse host cell types—including epithelial, stromal, and immune cells—and environmental elements like dietary components and the microbiota. Understanding the cellular networks that govern intestinal homeostasis and IBD pathogenesis necessitates high-resolution, system-level approaches. Previous research using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in IBD has begun to illustrate disease-associated changes in cell subsets and gene expression, for instance, in UC and in specific aspects of CD such as T-cell distributions in the TI or pediatric CD. However, a comprehensive, cross-organ comparison of the cellular and transcriptional landscape in both the ileum and colon in adult CD, particularly considering inflamed and non-inflamed tissues from the same individuals, is crucial for a deeper understanding of disease mechanisms and for identifying potential therapeutic targets.","['Single-cell Atlas Generation and Comprehensive Cell Type Annotation', 'Cell-Type Compositional Analysis Across Disease States and Anatomical Locations', 'Expression Profiling and Contextualization of IBD Risk Genes', 'Cell-Type Specific Differential Gene Expression (DGE) Analysis in Response to Inflammation', 'Characterization of Enteroendocrine Cell (EEC) Heterogeneity and Transcriptional Dysregulation in CD', 'Analysis of Myofibroblast States, Transitions, and Regulatory Networks in CD']","[{'title': 'Single-cell Atlas Generation and Comprehensive Cell Type Annotation', 'description': ""Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on 720,633 cells obtained from terminal ileum (TI) and colon (CO) biopsies of 46 Crohn's disease (CD) patients and 25 non-IBD controls.

"Human T lymphocytes are crucial components of the adaptive immune system, responsible for coordinating immune responses, establishing protective immunity, and maintaining homeostasis. They operate in diverse anatomical compartments, including blood, lymphoid tissues (like lymph nodes and bone marrow), and mucosal or barrier tissues (like lungs). T cell activation, typically initiated via the T cell receptor (TCR), triggers transcriptional programs leading to differentiation into effector cells with specific functions: CD4+ T cells primarily secrete cytokines to modulate other immune cells, while CD8+ T cells acquire cytotoxic capabilities to eliminate infected or cancerous cells. Following an immune response, some T cells develop into long-lived memory cells. These include circulating central memory (TCM) and effector memory (TEM) subsets, as well as non-circulating tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM) which persist locally within tissues. Studies, particularly in mouse models, highlight the importance of TRM cells in providing rapid, localized protection against pathogens. However, much of the understanding of human T cell function comes from studying peripheral blood. It's known that the majority of human T cells reside in tissues, not blood, and that T cell subset composition varies significantly depending on the tissue site. Human TRM cells share some core transcriptional and protein signatures with their mouse counterparts, distinguishing them from circulating T cells. Despite this, fundamental questions remain regarding how the tissue microenvironment influences human T cell persistence, functional responses upon activation, and the precise relationship between T cells in blood versus various tissues. Furthermore, while functional subsets (like Th1, Th2, Th17 for CD4+ T cells) and states (like exhaustion, marked by inhibitory receptors) have been characterized, often based on mouse studies or cytokine profiles, a comprehensive map of the diverse functional states of human T cells, particularly within different healthy tissues, is lacking. Establishing such a baseline understanding of healthy human T cell states across multiple anatomical locations is essential for interpreting T cell behavior in disease contexts, such as infections, autoimmunity, and cancer.","['Initial Characterization and Clustering of Tissue T cells', 'Comparison of Blood and Tissue T Cell Transcriptomes', 'Identification of a Core Tissue Gene Signature', 'Identification of Conserved T Cell Activation States using Factor Analysis', 'Visualization of T Cell Activation Trajectories', 'Mapping Tumor-Associated T Cells onto the Healthy Reference Atlas']","[{'title': 'Initial Characterization and Clustering of Tissue T cells', 'description': 'Single cell RNA-seq data from resting and anti-CD3/CD28-activated CD3+ T cells isolated from lung (LG), lymph node (LN), and bone marrow (BM) of two deceased organ donors were analyzed.

"Dental caries, initiated by acid-producing oral bacteria, leads to a progressive demineralization of enamel and dentin. As carious lesions advance towards the dentin-pulp interface, microbial components diffusing through dentinal tubules can trigger protective responses from stromal and immune cells within the dental pulp. This includes the formation of tertiary dentin by odontoblasts to wall off the infection. If the infectious tooth structure is removed and restored, tissue homeostasis can be regained. However, more severe stimuli, such as persistent deep carious lesions, can result in odontoblast death and the recruitment of pulp stem cells, which differentiate into odontoblast-like cells to secrete reparative dentin. When inflammation overwhelms healing mechanisms, this can lead to irreversible pulpitis and potentially pulp necrosis.
Traditional endodontic treatment, while an alternative to extraction, results in loss of tooth vitality. Regenerative dentistry approaches, including vital pulp therapy, particularly for immature permanent teeth, aim to reduce pulpal inflammation and preserve vitality using biomaterials and stem cell therapies. However, the indications for these regenerative procedures are currently limited. A delicate balance between inflammation and regeneration is essential for defending against cariogenic bacteria and subsequent inflammation resolution. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the functions of stromal and immune cells in dental pulp under both normal physiological and pathological (carious) conditions is crucial for advancing regenerative dentistry.
Previous studies have employed methods like multicolor flow cytometry to characterize heterogeneous mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in human dental pulp, though immune cell populations have been less extensively studied. Flow cytometry data suggests immune cells (neutrophils, T cells, macrophages, NK cells) constitute only about 1% of the total pulpal population, with B cells reportedly infiltrating inflamed pulp but not healthy pulp. A key limitation of flow cytometry is its reliance on a predefined set of cell surface markers, which may not capture the full cellular heterogeneity, including rare cell types or distinct functional subgroups.
Bulk transcriptomic studies have also been used to investigate global gene expression changes between healthy and inflamed pulpal tissues. These studies have revealed that genes in immune and inflammatory response pathways are upregulated in dental caries, while those in biosynthesis pathways are downregulated. However, bulk transcriptomics provide average gene expression levels across all cell types present in the tissue. This approach is often dominated by highly abundant cell types, potentially masking crucial information from minor but functionally significant cell types, such as various immune cell subsets.
While single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a powerful tool for detailed cellular characterization at the individual cell level, previous scRNA-seq studies on dental pulp have primarily focused on delineating cellular heterogeneity during human tooth development or on in-depth characterization of MSCs in healthy dental pulp tissues. There is a need to comprehensively explore the diverse cell populations and their specific transcriptomic profiles within the dental pulp in the context of both health (sound teeth) and varying stages of dental caries (e.g., enamel caries, deep dental caries) to better understand the molecular underpinnings of pulpal disease and inform future regenerative strategies.","['Single-Cell Transcriptome Generation and Quality Control from Human Dental Pulp', 'Integration, Clustering, and Visualization of Dental Pulp Single-Cell Transcriptomes', 'Cell Type Annotation and Compositional Analysis in Dental Pulp', 'Differential Gene Expression Analysis Across Caries Stages and Cell Types', 'Computational Prediction of Cell-Cell Interactions in Dental Pulp']","[{'title': 'Single-Cell Transcriptome Generation and Quality Control from Human Dental Pulp', 'description': ""Single-cell suspensions were prepared from human dental pulp tissues collected from sound molars, molars with enamel caries, and molars with deep dental caries.

"The spinal cord is a crucial component of the central nervous system, responsible for processing sensory inputs from the peripheral nervous system and controlling motor output by regulating motor neurons. These functions are executed by complex neural circuits, which are composed of numerous molecularly and physiologically distinct neuronal subtypes. During embryonic development, these diverse neuronal populations are generated in a highly organized spatiotemporal manner from proliferating progenitor cells residing within the embryonic neural tube and the neural crest. The precise arrangement of these progenitors and the identities of the neurons they produce are orchestrated by intricate gene regulatory networks (GRNs), which are themselves under the control of extrinsic signaling molecules. The composition and operation of these GRNs have been extensively investigated in model organisms such as mouse, chick, and zebrafish. In recent years, systematic profiling of single cells from the mouse neural tube and neural crest using techniques like scRNA-seq has provided comprehensive gene expression atlases, revealed underlying cellular complexity, and enabled detailed molecular classification of multiple cell types in these models. However, while much attention has been given to profiling the developing human brain, the embryonic human spinal cord and peripheral nervous system (PNS) have been comparatively less well-described. Available molecular characterizations suggest that the overall organization of progenitors and neurons is largely similar between humans and other vertebrates. Nevertheless, the precise extent of similarity in the molecular composition of cells in mouse and human neural tubes has not been fully determined, and several features of human neural tube development, such as the co-expression of transcription factors OLIG2 and NKX2-2 in a subset of neural progenitors, have been reported to differ from other species. A systematic and comprehensive profiling of cell identity in the developing human nervous system is thus essential to provide a clearer picture of human neural tube development and to enable detailed comparisons with other species.

"The airway epithelium serves as a crucial protective barrier within the respiratory system. It is primarily composed of three main cell types: ciliated cells, secretory cells, and basal cells. Ciliated cells are vital for mucociliary clearance, a process where they expel pathogens and foreign particles that have been trapped in mucus, which is produced by secretory cells. Basal cells act as the primary airway stem cells; they possess the ability to differentiate into both secretory and ciliated cells, thereby maintaining tissue homeostasis and facilitating repair following injury. This differentiation into ciliated cells can occur either through the direct differentiation of basal cells or via the transdifferentiation of existing secretory cells.

To investigate human lung development and create models for various respiratory diseases, human airway epithelial cells are frequently cultured in vitro. These cells are typically obtained from lung tissue biopsies and can be grown in two main formats: as three-dimensional (3D) airway organoids or within air-liquid interface (ALI) culture systems. Airway 3D organoids, often derived from basal or club cells, can be maintained for extended periods and can generate various differentiated cell types. However, a common limitation is their frequent failure to produce a significant population of ciliated cells. In contrast, ALI culture systems, where epithelial cells are cultured on a permeable membrane with the apical (top) side exposed to air and the basal (bottom) side in contact with culture medium, are designed to mimic the in vivo airway environment. This setup encourages basal cells to undergo proper differentiation, forming a pseudostratified epithelium that includes both ciliated and secretory cells, thus providing a more robust in vitro model of the human airway.

Despite the advantages of ALI culture, the methodology has not been universally standardized, which can impact its reliability and reproducibility across different studies. A persistent challenge is that even ALI systems may not consistently yield a sufficient quantity of ciliated cells to accurately reflect their proportions in the native human respiratory epithelium. Given that ciliated cells play an indispensable role in airway function and are critical for modeling respiratory diseases (including their role as primary targets for viral infections like SARS-CoV-2), the ability to generate in vitro models containing an adequate number of these specialized cells is of high importance. Consequently, identifying the specific molecular factors and key regulatory signaling pathways that govern the differentiation of ciliated cells is crucial for developing improved and more physiologically relevant in vitro airway epithelial models. This paper aims to explore the transcriptomic landscape of human lung organoids cultured under ALI conditions compared to submerged cultures to uncover these regulatory mechanisms influencing epithelial differentiation.","['Single-cell RNA-seq Data Preprocessing and Integration', 'Cell Type and Subtype Identification and Annotation', 'Comparative Cell Composition Analysis', 'RNA Velocity and Pseudotime Trajectory Analysis', 'Evaluation of Transcriptomic Similarity to In Vivo Lung Tissue', 'Differential Gene Expression Analysis Between Culture Conditions', 'Functional Interpretation, Network Analysis, and Upstream Regulator Identification from DEGs']","[{'title': 'Single-cell RNA-seq Data Preprocessing and Integration', 'description': ""Raw sequencing reads from eight samples were processed using Cell Ranger (v7.0.1) to generate gene-cell count matrices by aligning reads to the GRCh38 human reference genome.

"Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a life-limiting, multisystem, autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. The CFTR protein is crucial for regulating the pH and hydration of the epithelial lining fluid via chloride and bicarbonate transport. In the lungs of people with CF (pwCF), CFTR dysfunction leads to dehydrated and thickened epithelial lining fluid, acidification, and hypoxia. These changes result in impaired mucociliary clearance, with mucus tethering, loss of ciliary function, and reduced antimicrobial activity, creating a hyper-inflammatory state and predisposing to persistent bacterial infections, such as by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

While CFTR modulator therapies (e.g., Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor) have significantly improved clinical outcomes for many pwCF, including lung function and exacerbation frequency, they are not universally applicable due to side effects or drug-drug interactions. Furthermore, despite modulator therapy reducing systemic and local inflammatory markers, bacterial infections and airway inflammation often persist as substantial problems. Consequently, there remains a critical need for alternative treatment strategies for pwCF.

Effective anti-microbial immunity and the maintenance of lung homeostasis depend on continuous communication between structural cells (like epithelial cells) and immune cells. Disruptions in this epithelial-immune cell crosstalk are known to contribute to airway inflammation and irreversible tissue remodeling in other chronic respiratory diseases, such as COPD and asthma. The airways of pwCF also undergo extensive remodeling, and their immune system has an impaired capacity to clear infections.

Previous single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) studies in CF have provided insights into specific compartments. For instance, analyses of airway epithelial cells from pwCF showed increased secretory activity, reduced basal (stem) cell proliferation, and skewed differentiation towards ciliated cells, indicative of dysfunctional tissue repair. Studies on sputum samples from pwCF identified an influx of recruited monocytes and immature pro-inflammatory neutrophils, contrasting with the alveolar macrophage dominance in healthy controls. Investigations of lung tissue from pwCF revealed increased numbers of lymphoid follicles and activated B cells. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples from children with CF showed distinct macrophage populations and CD4+ T cells expressing inflammatory signaling genes, though statistical comparisons with healthy controls were often limited. Additionally, research has pointed to failures in adaptive immunity, such as ineffective T cell responses against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and altered T cell cytokine profiles in CF.

Despite these advances, these studies have largely focused on isolated cell types or compartments. A comprehensive transcriptional characterization of the full spectrum of both innate and adaptive immune cells in conjunction with structural cells from the same CF lung tissue microenvironment has been lacking. This gap in knowledge obscures a complete understanding of airway lymphocyte phenotypes and the nature of (dysregulated) structural-immune cell crosstalk in pwCF, and how these are altered in the disease state, which is critical for developing new therapeutic approaches to restore airway homeostasis.","['Generation and Integration of a Single-Cell Transcriptome Atlas from Bronchial Biopsies', 'Cell Type Annotation and Atlas Creation', 'Comparative Analysis of Cellular Composition in CF and Healthy Airways', 'Differential Gene Expression Analysis in Epithelial Cell Subsets', 'Differential Gene Expression Analysis in Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Prediction of Altered Intercellular Crosstalk using Ligand-Receptor Analysis']","[{'title': 'Generation and Integration of a Single-Cell Transcriptome Atlas from Bronchial Biopsies', 'description': ""Droplet-based single-cell RNA-sequencing (10X Chromium) was performed on bronchial biopsies obtained from three patients with cystic fibrosis (pwCF), yielding a total of 19,855 cells.

"The paper addresses a significant knowledge gap in the understanding of late-stage human lung development, particularly at the neonatal stage. While animal models, primarily murine, have provided extensive insights into the mechanisms controlling cell diversity and function in the developing mammalian lung, the direct applicability of these findings to human physiology, especially during the critical transition from fetal to neonatal life, is not fully understood. The human lung is a highly complex organ, comprising over 40 distinct cell types whose coordinated interactions are essential for proper development, including lineage specification, proliferation, differentiation, morphogenesis, and injury repair. Disruptions in these intricate developmental processes can contribute to the early-life origins of lung disease.

Current molecular characterization of human lung development has largely focused on earlier fetal stages, with a paucity of data describing the cellular landscape of the newborn human lung. This limitation has been partly due to the challenges in accessing high-quality human tissue suitable for molecular analysis. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's (NHLBI) Molecular Atlas of Lung Development Program (LungMAP) was established to overcome these hurdles by creating a comprehensive structural, cellular, and molecular atlas of both human and mouse lungs across various developmental stages. LungMAP serves as a crucial repository for multi-omics datasets and computational tools, facilitating research in pulmonary development.

Historically, many high-throughput molecular studies on lung development utilized whole lung tissue, which obscured cell-type-specific activities and interactions. The advent of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has revolutionized the ability to perform transcriptomic mapping of individual cells. This allows for an unprecedented understanding of cellular heterogeneity, the identification of distinct cell states, and the elucidation of molecular mechanisms within complex biological systems like the developing lung. scRNA-seq also enables unbiased comparisons across different species. Recognizing its power, consortia like the Human Cell Atlas have prioritized the characterization of lung tissue at single-cell resolution. This technology has been increasingly applied to identify both known and novel cell populations and to assess changes in cellular composition and gene expression during lung health, development, and disease. This study leverages these advancements to explore the cellular and molecular intricacies of the newborn human lung, with a focus on creating a cellular atlas and understanding differences in maturation states of various cell types.","['Initial scRNA-seq Characterization of Newborn Human Lung Cells', 'Cellular Annotation and Marker Gene Identification in Newborn Human Lung scRNA-seq Data', 'Processing and Characterization of a Reference Postnatal Mouse Lung scRNA-seq Dataset', 'Cross-Species Integration of Newborn Human and Postnatal Mouse Lung scRNA-seq Data', 'Cellular Annotation and Marker Gene Identification in the Integrated Human-Mouse scRNA-seq Dataset', 'Computational Estimation of Human Lung Cell Developmental Maturity Using a Mouse Lung Reference Trajectory', 'Differential Gene Expression Analysis to Identify Markers of Maturation States in Human Matrix Fibroblasts']","[{'title': 'Initial scRNA-seq Characterization of Newborn Human Lung Cells', 'description': 'Single-cell suspensions from two one-day-old newborn human lungs were processed.

"Gamma-delta (γδ) T cells represent a unique T cell subset that is produced in the thymus and, unlike conventional major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted alpha-beta (αβ) T cells, can directly seed peripheral tissues. These cells are capable of responding to diverse microbial stimuli independently of MHC-peptide recognition. Studies in mice have shown that developmental 'waves' of γδ T cells localize to barrier sites during embryogenesis, playing crucial roles in protective immunity, homeostasis, and tissue repair. A key characteristic of mouse γδ T cells is their tissue-specific distribution, often dictated by particular variable segments of the T cell receptor gamma (TCRγ) chain, which endows them with site-specific functions from birth.

In humans, γδ T cells are also generated during gestation, subsequently seeding tissues and being detectable in the blood. They have been implicated in immune responses against tumors and certain pathogens. Human γδ T cell subsets are primarily delineated by the TCR delta (TCRδ) chain, with two major subsets being Vδ1 and Vδ2, alongside rarer populations expressing Vδ3-8. Generally, tissues show an enrichment for Vδ1 cells, whereas peripheral blood predominantly contains Vδ2 cells, which often coexpress Vγ9. Much of the current understanding of human γδ T cell subsets is derived from studies of peripheral blood and the thymus. Human Vδ2Vγ9+ cells are often described as innate-like due to their capacity for direct effector and cytolytic functions originating from the thymus. In contrast, Vδ1+ cells typically exhibit more adaptive-like characteristics, such as variable effector functions, diverse TCR repertoires, and the ability to undergo clonal expansion in response to antigens. The composition of γδ T cell subsets in human blood changes with age, shifting from a higher proportion of Vδ1 cells at birth to a predominance of Vδ2 cells in older children and adults.

A significant gap in knowledge exists regarding the identity, maturation dynamics, and fate of human γδ T cells *within tissues* as individuals age, primarily due to the challenges in obtaining tissue samples across different life stages. The research group conducting this study has a history of investigating the human immune system in tissues by utilizing samples obtained from human organ donors of all ages, in collaboration with organ procurement organizations. These physiologically healthy samples permit the isolation of live cells for functional studies and high-dimensional single-cell profiling, enabling the study of immune cells across multiple tissues within an individual and providing insights into tissue-specific compartmentalization and adaptations. By integrating data from donors across a wide age range, from early life to adulthood, they aim to understand the development and maturation of tissue immune cells. For instance, they recently demonstrated that γδ T cells are present in human mucosal sites at birth, a time when αβ T cells are sparse, suggesting important roles for γδ T cells in early-life immunity. 

This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into human γδ T cells within blood, as well as mucosal and lymphoid tissues, sourced from organ donors and living blood donors spanning infancy to the ninth decade of life.

"Myocarditis, an inflammatory condition of the heart muscle characterized by inflammatory cell infiltration, can arise from various causes, including viral infections like SARS-CoV-2 or, infrequently, following mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccination. Despite its clinical significance, the precise cellular and molecular mechanisms that drive these different forms of myocarditis are not fully understood. COVID-19, primarily a respiratory illness, can lead to systemic and cardiovascular complications, with acute cardiac injury being a notable occurrence after severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Studies have indicated a substantially increased risk of developing myocarditis post-COVID-19. In children and young adults, SARS-CoV-2 infection can trigger multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C), where myocarditis is a prominent feature. Similarly, cardiac injury, although rare, has been observed after COVID-19 vaccination, particularly with mRNA vaccines. While direct viral damage to the myocardium by SARS-CoV-2 appears limited, the infection can provoke an intense systemic release of cytokines, potentially causing a secondary inflammatory response in the heart. Vaccine-associated myocardial inflammation has been described with features like systemic 'cytokinopathy', the presence of activated cytotoxic lymphocytes, or the induction of IL1-RA. Prior investigations using methods like immunohistochemistry on cardiac tissues have often pointed to a macrophage-dominated inflammatory infiltrate in myocarditis cases following both SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination. This study aims to elucidate the cardiac tissue responses at a cellular and molecular level in these distinct inflammatory cardiomyopathies.","['Cardiac Cell Atlas Generation and Single-Nucleus RNA Sequencing Data Processing', 'Identification and Annotation of Major Cardiac Cell Types', 'Major Cardiac Cell Type Compositional Analysis Across Patient Groups', 'Pseudo-bulk Differential Gene Expression Analysis in Cardiac Tissue', 'Myeloid Cell Subpopulation Characterization and Differential Analysis', 'Lymphoid Cell Subpopulation Characterization and Differential Analysis', 'Cardiomyocyte (CM) State Characterization and Gene Expression Analysis', 'Vascular Cell (Endothelial and Mural) State Characterization and Pathway Analysis', 'Fibroblast (FB) State Characterization and Gene Expression Analysis', 'Intercellular Communication Network Analysis', 'Analysis of MHC-I Pathway Gene Expression in Non-Immune and Specific Cardiac Cells']","[{'title': 'Cardiac Cell Atlas Generation and Single-Nucleus RNA Sequencing Data Processing', 'description': ""Nuclei were isolated from endomyocardial biopsies (EMBs) from myocarditis patients (Non-COVID-19, Post-COVID-19, Post-Vaccination, MIS-C) and from control donor left ventricular (LV) tissue.

"The vertebrate retina is a complex, multi-layered neuronal tissue responsible for converting light into electrical signals transmitted to the brain. It comprises six major neuronal cell classes (rods, cones, bipolar cells, horizontal cells, amacrine cells, and retinal ganglion cells (RGCs)) and several non-neuronal types like Müller glia. While the overall retinal structure is conserved across vertebrates, significant inter-species differences exist in cytoarchitecture, synaptic connections, and the number and types of cells within each class, particularly for amacrine and RGC types. This diversity suggests that findings from model organisms may not fully represent the human retina. The human retina itself is highly heterogeneous, containing an estimated 60 neuronal types whose abundances vary dramatically, with some types being exceedingly rare (e.g., certain RGCs constituting less than 0.05% of the total cell population). Previous single-cell transcriptomic studies have highlighted this heterogeneity, but a complete catalog of human retinal cell types, especially rare ones, requires extensive cell profiling and often targeted enrichment strategies. Beyond transcriptomics, understanding the epigenomic landscape at single-cell resolution is crucial for deciphering gene expression regulation dynamics and identifying regulatory elements, including non-coding variants associated with retinal disorders. While some studies have reported single-cell open chromatin profiles for the human retina, they often lacked extensive cell-type classification, with epigenomic information remaining largely at the broader cell-class level rather than at the specific cell-type level. Therefore, there is a need for a comprehensive, high-resolution atlas of the human retina that integrates transcriptomic and epigenomic data at the individual cell-type level to enable a deeper molecular characterization of retinal biology and disease mechanisms. Such an atlas would also be invaluable for understanding the regulatory landscape, as many disease-associated genetic variants map to non-coding, potential regulatory regions.","['Comprehensive Cell Type Classification from Single-Nucleus RNA-seq Data', 'Comparison of snRNA-seq-based Cell Type Classification with a Previous Atlas', 'Analysis of Cell Type Proportions between Central and Peripheral Retina using snRNA-seq', 'Assessment of NeuN-based Enrichment Strategy on Cell Type Proportions in Peripheral Retina snRNA-seq Data', 'Identification of Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) for Retinal Cell Types from snRNA-seq Data', 'Cross-species snRNA-seq Data Integration and Cell Type Homology Assessment', 'Characterization of snRNA-seq Expression Profiles for Genes Linked to Putative cis-Regulatory Elements (CREs)', 'Inference and Analysis of Transcription Factor (TF) Activity from snRNA-seq Data', 'Identification and Annotation of Transcription Factor (TF) Co-activity Modules using snRNA-seq-derived TF Activities', 'Supervised Classification using snRNA-seq to Identify Retinal Ganglion Cells (RGCs) in Additional Datasets']","[{'title': 'Comprehensive Cell Type Classification from Single-Nucleus RNA-seq Data', 'description': 'Single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) data from over 250,000 nuclei, obtained from six human donors (including peripheral retina samples enriched for rare cells using NeuN antibody sorting), was processed.

"The cerebral cortex is integral to complex cognitive functions, including language, which is a hallmark of human distinctiveness. However, the cellular and molecular underpinnings of these human-specific cognitive abilities, particularly those related to cortical specializations, remain largely elusive. While previous research has explored cortical cell type diversity and organization across various mammalian species, a comprehensive understanding of what makes the human cortex unique has been hampered. Comparative transcriptomic studies offer a path to identify conserved and specialized cellular and molecular features across species, but their insights are often constrained by the limited number of species analyzed and their phylogenetic distances. This study addresses these gaps by focusing on the middle temporal gyrus (MTG), a region of the cerebral cortex critically involved in multimodal sensory integration and language comprehension. Anatomically, the human MTG is known to be larger and more extensively connected to other language-associated cortical areas compared to its homolog in nonhuman primates (NHPs). Such anatomical distinctions are hypothesized to correlate with underlying differences in the molecular programs of cortical cells. Earlier comparative studies in primates were often limited by analyzing broad, heterogeneous cell populations or by lacking a sufficient representation of great ape species, which is crucial for discerning human-specific evolutionary trajectories from those shared with our closest relatives. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) technology provides an unprecedented opportunity for unbiased, high-resolution characterization of cellular diversity within complex tissues like the brain. This research leverages deep snRNA-seq profiling of the MTG from five primate species: humans, chimpanzees, gorillas (representing great apes), rhesus macaques (an Old World monkey), and common marmosets (a New World monkey). This selection spans approximately 38 million years of primate evolution, enabling a detailed multi-species comparison. The inclusion of gorillas, alongside chimpanzees, allows for more precise inference of changes unique to the human lineage, distinguishing them from traits shared among African great apes. The two monkey species provide a broader phylogenetic context to identify features that are specific to great apes or are more deeply conserved across primates. The primary scientific goal is to construct a comparative cellular atlas of the primate MTG. This atlas aims to identify homologous cell types across these species and to uncover human-specific molecular and cellular features, which may contribute to the unique cognitive capacities of humans.","['Generation of Within-Species Cell Type Taxonomies', 'Comparative Analysis of Cell Type Abundances Across Species', 'Assessment of Subclass Transcriptomic Conservation and Divergence Across Primates', 'Differential Gene Expression Analysis in Glial Cell Lineages Across Great Apes', 'Construction of a Cross-Species Consensus Primate MTG Cell Type Taxonomy', 'Identification of Species-Specific Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) within Consensus Cell Types', 'Comparative Analysis of Transcript Isoform Usage Across Great Ape Cell Subclasses', 'Integration of Human-Specific DEGs with Genomic Regions of Accelerated Evolution', 'Spatial Characterization of Human MTG Cell Types using snRNA-seq-Informed MERFISH']","[{'title': 'Generation of Within-Species Cell Type Taxonomies', 'description': ""For each of the five primate species (human, chimpanzee, gorilla, rhesus macaque, marmoset), snRNA-seq datasets were independently processed to create a cell type taxonomy.

"T cell development, or thymopoiesis, is a critical process occurring in the thymus, essential for a functional adaptive immune system. This development relies on the continuous migration of hematopoietic progenitor cells from the bone marrow to the thymus. Once in the thymic microenvironment, these multipotent progenitors undergo commitment to the T cell lineage, a process significantly driven by Notch1 signaling, and extensive proliferation to expand the T cell precursor pool. Much of our current understanding of these early events, including the precise nature of the thymus-seeding progenitors (TSPs), comes from studies in mouse models. However, translating these findings to human biology is challenging due to species-specific differences in cell surface markers (e.g., CD25 expression in early T cell development) and potentially distinct molecular regulatory mechanisms. Immature human thymocytes are generally identified by the expression of CD34. Within this CD34+ population, further heterogeneity exists. For instance, CD1a expression is traditionally used to mark T-lineage commitment, but commitment processes are known to initiate even before CD1a upregulation, within the CD34+CD1a- fraction. This CD34+CD1a-CD44+ subset is considered uncommitted and is expected to contain the immigrating TSPs. However, the precise identity and characteristics of these human TSPs have been a subject of debate, with conflicting reports regarding the role of markers like CD7 (e.g., whether CD34+CD7- or CD34+CD7int cells are the true TSPs). Furthermore, it remains unclear to what extent other hematopoietic lineages, such as myeloid or B cell lineages, develop within the human thymus from these early progenitors, as current knowledge largely stems from in vitro studies whose in vivo relevance is not fully established.

"Pancreatic islets play a pivotal role in maintaining glucose homeostasis through the coordinated action of their diverse constituent endocrine and affiliate cell types. These cell types include insulin-secreting beta (β) cells, glucagon-secreting alpha (α) cells, somatostatin-secreting delta (δ) cells, pancreatic polypeptide-secreting gamma (γ) cells, and ghrelin-secreting epsilon (ε) cells, which collectively determine the islet's functional output. In human islets, these cells are intermingled, facilitating their response to fluctuating glucose levels. Pancreatic islets are central to the genetics and pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes (T2D), primarily through their involvement in insulin secretion defects. There is increasing evidence suggesting that intercellular signaling, such as signals from α- and δ-cells, regulates β-cell function to ensure appropriate insulin secretion. Therefore, a robust understanding of islet cell type-specific gene expression programs and their dysregulation in pathological states like T2D is crucial for defining and understanding pancreatic dysfunction. However, achieving a comprehensive view of these alterations has been challenging. Previous studies have often been limited by factors such as inter-donor variability, modest sample sizes, and/or a relatively small number of cells sampled per individual, which can hinder the ability to detect consistent and reproducible differences associated with T2D.","['Single-cell RNA sequencing library preparation and initial data processing', 'Iterative quality control and doublet removal for single-cell RNA-seq data', 'Integrated analysis for unsupervised clustering and cell type annotation', 'Definition of robust cell type-specific signature genes', 'Functional enrichment analysis of cell type signature genes', 'Identification of sex-specific differentially expressed genes in major endocrine cell types', 'Assessment of islet cell type composition changes across glycemic states', 'Correlation analysis of endocrine cell proportions with HbA1c levels', 'Cell type-specific differential gene expression analysis between glycemic states using pseudobulk profiles', 'Functional pathway enrichment analysis of T2D-associated β-cell DEGs', 'Subclustering analysis to identify putative subpopulations within major endocrine cell types', 'Comparison of endocrine cell subpopulation proportions across glycemic states']","[{'title': 'Single-cell RNA sequencing library preparation and initial data processing', 'description': ""Pancreatic islets from 48 donors (17 ND, 17 T2D, 14 PD) were cultured.

"The skin, as the human body's outermost protective barrier, is composed of two primary layers: the epidermis, predominantly made up of keratinocytes, and the underlying dermis. The dermis is a thicker layer crucial for skin architecture and function, largely consisting of an extracellular matrix (ECM) produced by its numerous fibroblasts. Fibroblasts are essential cells with well-established heterogeneity, exemplified by differences between papillary fibroblasts (in the superficial dermis) and reticular fibroblasts (in the deeper dermis) in terms of morphology, proliferation rates, contractility, response to growth factors, and expression of ECM components like collagens. Functionally, the papillary dermis and its fibroblasts are vital for epidermal organization, partly due to their close interactions with keratinocytes, and are known to be significantly impacted by intrinsic skin aging, which contributes to visible clinical signs such as reduced turgor and increased wrinkling. Beyond their structural roles in ECM production, dermal fibroblasts exhibit functional diversity, actively participating in cutaneous immune responses, wound healing processes, and communication with the nervous and vascular systems within the skin. 

Historically, the characterization of skin cell types, including fibroblast subpopulations, has relied on techniques such as reporter constructs and lineage tracing in mouse models, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) using predetermined markers, and immunohistochemistry (IHC). While these methods have provided valuable insights, they are often limited by the need for pre-selected markers or may not fully capture the comprehensive transcriptomic diversity of cell populations. Previous single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) studies on skin fibroblasts have offered initial glimpses into their heterogeneity but were sometimes constrained by low cell numbers, reliance on mouse models, focus on specific conditions like skin injury, or the analysis of chronically sun-exposed skin. Chronic sun exposure leads to photoaging, which can confound the study of intrinsic, chronological aging. Consequently, a systematic and comprehensive analysis of fibroblast heterogeneity in sun-protected human skin, particularly concerning the transcriptomic changes that occur during intrinsic aging, has been an area requiring further investigation. Understanding these age-related molecular shifts within fibroblast populations holds significant implications for elucidating the mechanisms of human skin aging and its associated phenotypes.","['Comprehensive Cell Atlas Generation and Annotation of Human Sun-Protected Skin', 'Identification and Functional Characterization of Dermal Fibroblast Subpopulations in Young Donors', 'Collagen Gene Expression Profiling Across Young Fibroblast Subpopulations', 'Prediction of Dermal Localization for Young Fibroblast Subpopulations using Gene Signatures', 'Defining Specific Molecular Markers for Distinct Fibroblast Subpopulations', 'Comparative Transcriptomic Analysis of Fibroblast Subpopulations Between Young and Old Donors', 'Profiling of Skin Aging-Associated Secreted Protein (SAASP) Gene Expression in Aged Fibroblasts', 'Computational Prediction of Intercellular Communication Networks and Their Age-Related Alterations']","[{'title': 'Comprehensive Cell Atlas Generation and Annotation of Human Sun-Protected Skin', 'description': ""Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed on whole-skin samples from five healthy male donors (two young, 25-27 y/o; three old, 53-70 y/o) from a sun-protected inguinoiliac region.

"Tendon injuries, particularly ruptures, are common clinical problems that often lead to significant pain, disability, and a reduced quality of life, with increasing incidence and socioeconomic costs. These injuries frequently heal poorly, forming granulation (scar) tissue that fails to restore the native mechanical and structural properties of healthy tendon extracellular matrix (ECM), rendering the tendon weaker and susceptible to re-rupture or progression to chronic disease. While tendon ruptures in humans have often been studied during the chronic phase of injury, especially in rotator cuff disease, the early cellular and molecular responses to acute tendon ruptures remain less investigated. A deeper understanding of the cell types contributing to both tendon homeostasis and, critically, the early injury response is crucial for developing strategies to biologically augment tendon repair and improve patient outcomes. Transcriptomic mapping of tendons at single-cell resolution has recently allowed the cellular and molecular landscapes of healthy human hamstring tendons to be deciphered. Healthy human tendon tissue, though having low overall cellular content, contains several cell types including fibroblasts (sometimes termed tenocytes, responsible for ECM production and maintenance), endothelial cells, and various immune cells. Previous research, often in murine models or human chronic tendinopathy, has implicated epitenon or perivascular derived cells as origins for repair fibroblasts, and immune cells like macrophages as key orchestrators. Fibroblast activation has been documented in chronic human tendinopathy. However, the specific fibroblast cell types and states, as well as the comprehensive roles of immune, endothelial, and mural cell compartments, particularly in the early human response to an acute tendon rupture, have not been well characterized. The paucity of knowledge on the cell types acting early in the tendon repair process limits progress in improving patient outcomes. This study focuses on human quadriceps tendons, which are frequently subject to acute rupture requiring surgical repair, thus providing a relevant model to explore the cellular components and molecular characteristics of the fibroproliferative phases of early human tendon injury.","['snRNA-seq Data Preprocessing, Quality Control, Integration, and Initial Cell Type Annotation', 'Differential Abundance Testing of Cell Populations', 'Pseudobulk Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Analysis', 'Sub-clustering and Fine Annotation of Major Cell Lineages', 'Ligand-Receptor Interaction Analysis', 'Inference of Intracellular Pathway and Transcription Factor Activity', 'Single-Cell Regulatory Network Inference and Clustering (SCENIC)']","[{'title': 'snRNA-seq Data Preprocessing, Quality Control, Integration, and Initial Cell Type Annotation', 'description': ""Raw next generation sequencing (NGS) data were quality controlled using fastqc (v0.12.1) and mapped to the human Ensembl GRCh38 transcriptome (release 106) using kallisto bustools kb count (v0.27.3 with kmer size = 31) via the scflow quantnuclei pipeline (python v3.8.15).

"The intestine is a vital organ with multifaceted roles including nutrient digestion and absorption, defense against microbes, immune responses, and hormone secretion. While foundational knowledge about major intestinal cell types has been established, particularly through studies on mouse models, a comprehensive understanding of human intestinal cell type-specific markers and their precise functional roles has remained limited.

"Heart failure is a significant global health problem, contributing to substantial morbidity, mortality, and healthcare expenditure. A deeper understanding of its cellular and molecular underpinnings is essential for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. While bulk RNA sequencing has offered some insights into disease mechanisms, it inherently loses cell-type-specific information, which is critical as the heart comprises diverse cell populations with distinct roles in health and disease. 

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) have emerged as powerful tools to dissect this cellular heterogeneity and identify transcriptional signatures at an unprecedented resolution. Seminal studies have begun to map the cellular landscape of the healthy human heart, identifying both common and rare cell populations and revealing diversity among various cell types, including perivascular and immune cells across different anatomical regions. 

However, our understanding of the functional relevance of this cellular diversity within major human cardiac cell populations, especially in the context of disease, remains limited. The impact of human cardiac disease on the heart's cellular composition and transcriptional states has not yet been rigorously or comprehensively investigated. While extensive research has been conducted using mouse models of heart failure, existing scRNA-seq datasets exploring human heart failure are often small. These studies may lack the necessary sample size or statistical power to fully elucidate the impact of disease on both common and rare cardiac cell types, or to comprehensively characterize the changes within these populations. 

Specifically, there is a need to understand how different cell types in the human heart respond to chronic heart failure, such as dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), and how factors like age might influence these responses. This paper seeks to address these gaps by performing a large-scale, integrated single-cell and single-nucleus transcriptomic analysis of heart tissue from a substantial cohort of healthy individuals and patients with chronic heart failure. The overarching goal is to define the cellular composition of the healthy and failing human heart, identify cell-type-specific transcriptional programs, and understand how these are reshaped by disease and age, thereby providing a valuable resource for the cardiovascular research community.","['Integration of Single-Cell and Single-Nucleus RNA-Seq Datasets', 'Unsupervised Clustering and Global Cardiac Cell Type Identification', 'Cell-Type Specific Differential Gene Expression Analysis', 'Analysis of Cardiac Cell Composition Changes', 'Investigation of Age-Associated Transcriptional Signatures and Composition', 'Identification and Characterization of Cell-Type Specific Substates', 'Pseudotime Trajectory Analysis for Cell State Transitions and Differentiation', 'Functional Enrichment Analysis of Gene Sets', 'Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for Transcriptional Variance Exploration']","[{'title': 'Integration of Single-Cell and Single-Nucleus RNA-Seq Datasets', 'description': ""Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from 7 individuals (2 donor, 5 DCM) and single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) data from 38 individuals (25 donor, 13 DCM) were generated from left ventricular cardiac tissue.

"Regulatory T (Treg) cells are a specialized subset of CD4+ T cells critical for maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing excessive immune responses. These cells are not a homogenous population; particularly in non-lymphoid tissues (NLTs) like the skin and colon, Treg cells acquire unique tissue-specific adaptations, differentiating them from their counterparts in lymphoid tissues (LTs) such as lymph nodes and spleen. These adaptations include the expression of an effector phenotype, specific chemokine receptors, integrins, and other molecules that enable their trafficking, retention, and function within distinct tissue environments.

"The adult mammalian brain retains the capacity for ongoing neurogenesis, a process largely sustained by neural stem cells (NSCs) residing in specialized niches, such as the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles. These SVZ NSCs are critical for normal brain function, contributing to cellular plasticity and olfactory bulb neurogenesis, and hold significant potential for brain repair following injury. Functionally, NSCs exist in a dynamic equilibrium between quiescence, a state of relative dormancy, and activation, where they proliferate and differentiate to generate new neurons and glia. The precise molecular mechanisms that govern these state transitions, maintain the NSC pool, and direct their lineage choices are complex and not fully understood.
Emerging evidence has pointed towards considerable heterogeneity within the NSC population. NSCs can differ in their proliferative activity, expression of canonical stem cell markers (e.g., GLAST, GFAP, Prominin1), and their potential to give rise to diverse neuronal and glial progeny. These differences suggest that distinct subtypes of NSCs may coexist, possibly with predetermined fates or responses to stimuli. However, previous research into NSC heterogeneity has often been constrained by reliance on a limited set of markers, bulk population analyses that obscure single-cell variations, or studies on potentially mixed cell populations. Consequently, a comprehensive understanding of the molecular landscape defining NSC identity, their activation status (from deep quiescence to active proliferation), and their lineage priming at the single-cell level has remained elusive.
Furthermore, following brain injuries like ischemia, endogenous NSCs are known to be activated and can contribute to the repair process by generating new cells. Yet, it is unclear how different subpopulations of NSCs sense and respond to injury signals, what molecular triggers orchestrate their activation from a dormant state, and whether pre-existing lineage commitments influence their regenerative response. Unraveling these aspects is crucial for developing strategies to harness NSCs for therapeutic purposes. This paper aims to address these knowledge gaps by employing an unbiased approach to dissect the molecular heterogeneity of adult SVZ NSCs in their native niche, both during normal homeostasis and in response to brain injury, using single-cell transcriptomics.","['Initial Cell Type Identification from SVZ Sorts using PCA', 'Uncovering Neural Stem Cell Heterogeneity using Hierarchical Clustering', 'Pseudotemporal Ordering of NSC Activation States', 'Comparative Transcriptomic Analysis of SVZ NSCs and Parenchymal Astrocytes', 'Identification of Transcription Factor Signatures Defining NSC Activation States', 'Analysis of Signaling Pathway Component Expression in NSC Subtypes', 'Correlation Analysis of Lineage-Specific Transcription Factors in NSCs', 'Transcriptomic Analysis of NSC Response to Ischemic Brain Injury']","[{'title': 'Initial Cell Type Identification from SVZ Sorts using PCA', 'description': 'Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed on the single-cell RNA-seq transcriptomes of 104 GLAST+/Prominin1+ sorted cells and 26 PSA-NCAM+ sorted cells from the adult mouse SVZ.

"The human endocrine pancreas, primarily organized into structures called islets of Langerhans, plays a critical role in maintaining blood glucose homeostasis. These islets are composed of several specialized endocrine cell types, including insulin-producing β-cells, glucagon-producing α-cells, somatostatin-producing δ-cells, pancreatic polypeptide-producing PP-cells, and ghrelin-producing ε-cells. While rodent islets have a distinct core-mantle structure, human islets feature intermingled endocrine cells, with β-cells constituting approximately 54% of the endocrine cell population. There is considerable scientific interest in understanding the heterogeneity within these endocrine cell populations. It is recognized that not all cells of a specific type, such as β-cells, are identical, and this heterogeneity can be particularly relevant under conditions of metabolic stress, as seen in obesity or type 2 diabetes. For instance, in type 2 diabetes, it has been suggested that a subset of pancreatic cells may exhibit dysfunction, potentially through reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion or by undergoing a process of dedifferentiation. Traditional methods for studying gene expression, such as bulk analysis of whole islets or even sorted cell populations, often obscure subtle but important differences. These methods can dilute signals from rare cell states, mask changes occurring in specific subpopulations, or fail to uncover novel transcriptional mechanisms due to the averaging of expression across many cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a powerful technology to overcome these limitations. By enabling the transcriptional profiling of individual cells, scRNA-seq allows for the detailed examination of gene expression variation within a population of seemingly similar cells and can reveal previously unappreciated cellular heterogeneity. This study utilizes scRNA-seq to investigate the transcriptomes of human pancreatic endocrine cells obtained from deceased organ donors representing four distinct developmental and physiological states: early childhood, normal adulthood, type 1 diabetes, and type 2 diabetes. The goal is to gain deeper insights into cellular diversity and the transcriptional changes that occur in these different contexts.","['Computational Pipeline for Single-Cell Type Annotation and Doublet Identification', 'Quantification of Background RNA Contamination', 'Validation of Single-Cell Type Classification Accuracy', 'Assessment of In Vitro Islet Culture Duration on Gene Expression', 'Comparative Transcriptomic Analysis of Alpha and Beta Cells Across Age and Type 2 Diabetes', 'Transcriptomic and Pathway Analysis of a Naturally Proliferating Alpha-Cell', 'Re-analysis of Cells with Conflicted or Ambiguous Expression Profiles']","[{'title': 'Computational Pipeline for Single-Cell Type Annotation and Doublet Identification', 'description': ""A five-step computational pipeline was developed and applied to annotate cell types and remove potential doublets from 635 single-cell RNA-seq profiles. 1) Cells were initially classified based on the expression of well-established marker genes (e.g., GCG for α-cells, INS for β-cells, SST for δ-cells, PPY for PP-cells, GHRL for ε-cells, PRSS1 for acinar, KRT19 for ductal) using normal mixture modeling (mclust R package) and violin plots. 2) Preliminary gene expression signatures for different cell types were derived by comparing the transcriptome of each cell type to the remaining cells within the same broad category (endocrine or exocrine). 3) These initial signatures were used to refine cell type classification by calculating the correlation of each cell's expression profile to its corresponding cell type-specific signature. 4) Cells that passed these initial tests were used to re-derive more robust, refined gene expression signatures for each cell type. 5) To identify and exclude doublets, in silico mixed expression profiles representing all possible combinations of two pure cell types were constructed.

"Endometriosis is a prevalent and debilitating gynecological condition affecting approximately 10% of reproductive-aged women globally, impacting an estimated 175 million individuals. It is clinically defined by the presence of endometrial-like tissue (glands and stroma) growing outside the uterine cavity, commonly causing chronic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea (painful menstruation), and infertility. Beyond these symptoms, endometriosis is also epidemiologically linked to an increased risk of certain subtypes of epithelial ovarian cancer, specifically clear cell and endometrioid carcinomas.
The disease presents in various forms, including ovarian cysts known as endometriomas, superficial lesions on the peritoneum, and deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE), where lesions penetrate more than 5mm beneath the peritoneal surface. A significant challenge in studying endometriosis stems from the fact that lesions are often microscopic and exhibit considerable cellular heterogeneity. This inherent complexity makes traditional bulk genomic characterization methods, which average signals across all cells and are better suited for homogenous cell populations, less effective for elucidating specific cellular contributions to the disease. Furthermore, common surgical treatments like ablation can destroy tissue, limiting the availability of high-quality material for comprehensive molecular research.
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) presents a powerful technological advancement to address these challenges. By profiling the transcriptomes of individual cells, scRNA-seq allows for the deconstruction of heterogeneous tissues, enabling the creation of detailed cellular atlases of endometriosis and related tissues. This approach can help identify and characterize the diverse cell types, including endometrial-type epithelial and stromal cells, as well as immune and other microenvironmental cells, within various lesion types (e.g., eutopic endometrium, endometriomas, peritoneal endometriosis). A thorough understanding of the cellular and molecular landscape at the single-cell level is crucial for unraveling disease mechanisms, discovering potential diagnostic biomarkers, and identifying novel therapeutic targets for endometriosis.","['Generation and Comprehensive Annotation of a Single-Cell Atlas of Endometriosis and Related Tissues', 'Comparative Analysis of Cellular Composition Across Different Tissue Types and Disease States', 'In-depth Characterization of Epithelial Cell Heterogeneity and Hormonal Responses', 'Differential Gene Expression Analysis in Endometrial-Type Epithelium Across Anatomic Sites', 'Investigation of Transcriptomic Consequences of ARID1A and KRAS Somatic Mutations in Endometrial Epithelium', 'Characterization of Mesenchymal and Endometrial Stromal Cell Heterogeneity and Hormonal Responses', 'Differential Gene Expression Analysis in Endometrial Stromal Cells Across Anatomic Sites', 'Identification of Molecular Signatures Distinguishing Deep Infiltrating versus Superficial Peritoneal Endometriosis', 'Spatial Transcriptomic Analysis of Peritoneal Endometriosis Lesions', 'Deconvolution of Bulk Ovarian Cancer Transcriptomes Using Single-Cell Derived Epithelial Signatures']","[{'title': 'Generation and Comprehensive Annotation of a Single-Cell Atlas of Endometriosis and Related Tissues', 'description': 'Droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed on over 370,000 individual cells obtained from 49 tissue specimens.

"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, poses a significant global health threat, with respiratory failure being a primary cause of mortality. The human lung is the principal organ affected by the virus, exhibiting severe pathological changes. While older individuals, particularly those over 65, face the highest risk of severe complications and mortality, the precise cellular and molecular mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 infection drives lung pathology remain inadequately understood. Previous histological studies on post-mortem lung tissues from COVID-19 patients have revealed key pathological hallmarks, including bilateral diffuse alveolar damage, respiratory inflammation, hyaline membrane formation, microvascular complications, and fibrosis. Despite these observations, a more granular understanding at the cellular and molecular level across the diverse cell types within the lung is lacking.

"The human eye contains complex tissues, the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the choroid, which are essential for providing support to the light-sensing retina. The RPE is a single layer of pigmented cells with multiple functions critical for photoreceptor health, including recycling visual pigments (retinoids), phagocytosing shed photoreceptor outer segments, absorbing stray light, mitigating oxidative stress, and providing metabolic support. Underlying the RPE is the choroid, a heterogeneous connective tissue that not only supports the RPE and outer retina but also houses diverse cell types such as fibroblasts, melanocytes, contractile pericytes/smooth muscle cells, and various immune cells. A key feature of the choroid is its rich vascular system, responsible for supplying approximately 85% of the blood to the retina. This vasculature includes the choriocapillaris, a dense, specialized capillary network, along with underlying medium (Sattler's layer) and large-diameter (Haller's layer) vessels. The choriocapillaris is particularly vital for retinal function, possessing fenestrated endothelial cells that allow molecule passage. It also expresses specific markers like HLA class I antigens, ICAM-1, and carbonic anhydrase 4 (CA4), indicating its role in regulating the local metabolic and inflammatory environment.
Dysfunction in either the RPE or the choroid can lead to severe vision loss, notably in age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of irreversible blindness in Western populations. Both RPE degeneration (leading to drusen and inflammation) and choroidal issues are implicated in AMD. Specifically, vascular dropout within the choroid has been observed to precede RPE changes, suggesting choroidal vascular disease as a potential primary event. The membrane attack complex (MAC) of the complement system, a lytic pore-forming structure, is found at increased levels in the choriocapillaris with aging and in AMD, pointing to complement-mediated damage.
Historically, gene expression studies of the RPE and choroid have often relied on analyzing mRNA from pooled tissue lysates due to the technical difficulty of separating these intimately connected tissues. Furthermore, the inherent cellular heterogeneity of the choroid has made it challenging to define gene expression patterns specific to individual cell populations, thereby limiting a deeper understanding of normal choroidal physiology and its alterations in disease. Single-cell RNA sequencing offers a powerful approach to overcome these limitations by enabling the study of gene expression profiles at the individual cell level within such complex tissues.","['Initial Cell Type Identification and Transcriptomic Profiling in Unselected Human RPE/Choroid (Experiment 1)', 'Characterization and Differential Gene Expression Analysis of Schwann Cell Subpopulations in RPE/Choroid (Experiment 1)', 'Comparative Gene Expression Analysis of Nonmyelinating Schwann Cells from an AMD Donor versus Non-AMD Donors (Experiment 1)', 'Regional Differential Gene Expression Analysis (Macula vs. Periphery) within RPE/Choroid Cell Types (Experiment 1)', 'Comparative Transcriptomic Analysis of Endothelial Cells from Human Retina versus Choroid', 'Cell Type Identification and Transcriptomic Profiling in CD31-Enriched Human Choroidal Cells (Experiment 2)', 'Transcriptomic Definition of Arterial, Venous, and Choriocapillaris Endothelial Cell Subtypes in the Human Choroid (Experiment 2)', 'Regional Differential Gene Expression Analysis (Macula vs. Periphery) within Choroidal Endothelial Cell Subtypes (Experiment 2)', 'Comparative Gene Expression Analysis of Choriocapillaris Endothelial Cells from an AMD Donor versus Non-AMD Donors (Experiment 2)']","[{'title': 'Initial Cell Type Identification and Transcriptomic Profiling in Unselected Human RPE/Choroid (Experiment 1)', 'description': ""Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on dissociated RPE/choroid samples from macular and peripheral 8-mm punches of 3 human donor eyes (6 samples total).

"Plant diseases represent significant threats to global food security and agricultural sustainability. Understanding the intricate molecular mechanisms that govern plant-pathogen interactions is crucial for developing effective disease resistance strategies. Pathogen infection in plants is a highly dynamic process, and host responses can be remarkably heterogeneous across different cells and tissues. This heterogeneity is influenced by factors such as the pathogen's distribution within the host tissue, its developmental stage, and the specific plant cell type involved. For instance, fungal pathogens, like the hemibiotrophic Colletotrichum species, undergo complex morphological changes and engage in distinct interactions with host cells during different phases of infection (biotrophic and necrotrophic). Traditional transcriptomic methods, such as bulk RNA-sequencing, often mask this cellular-level heterogeneity, averaging out responses and obscuring the precise contributions of individual cell types to immunity or susceptibility. Plants possess a sophisticated immune system involving cell-surface receptors (like RLKs and RLPs) that detect extracellular pathogen signatures, and intracellular receptors (like NLRs) that recognize pathogen effectors delivered into host cells. NLRs are diverse and can be classified into subfamilies (e.g., TNLs, CNLs, RNLs). However, a detailed understanding of how the expression and function of these various immune components vary across different cell types, especially during the dynamic process of pathogen infection, remains largely elusive. Bridging this knowledge gap is essential for a comprehensive view of plant defense mechanisms and for pinpointing specific cellular targets for enhancing crop resilience.","['Single-Cell Transcriptome Atlas Generation and Cell Type Annotation', 'Cell-Type-Specific Differential Gene Expression Analysis in Response to Fungal Infection', 'Cell-Type-Specific Expression Profiling of Immune Receptor Genes (NLRs and RLKs)', 'Phylogenetic Analysis Coupled with Cell-Type-Specific Expression of TIR Domain-Containing Proteins', 'Characterization and Sub-Clustering of Infection-Associated Cell Populations', 'Trajectory Inference and Pseudotime Analysis to Model Infection Dynamics', 'Identification and Functional Annotation of Pseudotime-Dependent Genes', 'Guard Cell-Specific Analysis of Abscisic Acid (ABA) Signaling Dynamics during Infection', 'Cell-Type-Specific Analysis of Glucosinolate (GSL) Biosynthesis Gene Induction at Fungal Infection Sites']","[{'title': 'Single-Cell Transcriptome Atlas Generation and Cell Type Annotation', 'description': ""Protoplasts were isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana leaves, either mock-treated or infected with the fungal pathogen Colletotrichum higginsianum at 24 and 40 hours post-inoculation (hpi).

"Cervical cancer (CC) is a significant global health issue, recognized as one of the most common gynecological malignancies and a leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women. The development of CC is largely associated with persistent Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection, though other genetic factors also contribute to its etiology. Clinically, while early-stage CC can often be managed effectively with treatments like surgery or radiation therapy, leading to favorable long-term survival, cases diagnosed at advanced or metastasized stages face a grim prognosis and are generally considered incurable. Current therapeutic strategies for advanced or recurrent CC, including anti-angiogenesis treatments and immunotherapy, offer limited success, with low overall response rates. This therapeutic challenge is substantially attributed to the pronounced inter-tumor and intra-tumor heterogeneity inherent in CC. Consequently, a deeper understanding of this heterogeneity at a high-resolution cellular level is paramount for the development of more precise and effective personalized therapeutic interventions. Previous large-scale genomic and transcriptomic studies, such as those by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), have characterized CC using bulk tissue samples, identifying molecular subtypes. However, these bulk analyses inherently average out signals across diverse cell populations, thereby obscuring the true extent of cellular heterogeneity within both the cancerous epithelial cells and the broader tumor microenvironment (TME). Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology provides a powerful tool to dissect this complex cellular landscape. The authors note that their prior work using scRNA-seq had already offered preliminary insights into the phenotypic diversity and ecological systems within the CC TME. This paper aims to extend that work by presenting a comprehensive scRNA-seq-based characterization of cellular heterogeneity in human CC, with the overarching goal of leveraging these insights to inform and advance personalized prognostic and therapeutic strategies for CC patients.","['Global cell type identification and characterization from scRNA-seq data', 'Inference of copy number aberrations (CNAs) in epithelial cell subpopulations', 'Functional enrichment analysis of epithelial cell subpopulations', 'Regulatory network inference in malignant epithelial subclusters', 'Subclustering and characterization of fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells (SMCs)', 'Transcriptional profiling and functional analysis of tumor-derived fibroblasts versus normal fibroblasts', 'Identification and functional differentiation of inflammatory (iCAF) and myofibroblastic (myCAF) cancer-associated fibroblast subtypes', 'Subclustering and detailed annotation of T cell populations', 'Detailed characterization of CD8+ T cell subtypes and their functional states', 'Pseudo-time trajectory analysis to delineate CD8+ T cell differentiation paths']","[{'title': 'Global cell type identification and characterization from scRNA-seq data', 'description': 'Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed on 57,669 cells derived from three cervical cancer (CC) tumors and paired normal adjacent non-tumor (NAT) samples.

"The mammalian cerebral cortex undergoes a complex developmental process involving carefully orchestrated cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration, resulting in a diverse array of neuronal and non-neuronal cell types. In mice, this development is particularly active between embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5) and birth (P0), leading to the formation of six distinct neocortical layers. Key cellular players include neural stem cells in the ventricular zone (VZ), intermediate progenitors in the subventricular zone (SVZ), and radial glia (RG), which divide symmetrically or asymmetrically to produce neurons. These terminally differentiated neurons then migrate radially to their final destinations in an 'inside-out' manner, meaning deeper layers are formed before superficial layers. This lamination process is tightly regulated by the dynamic expression of various transcription factors, such as CTIP2 (Bcl11b), Fezf2, and Satb2, which also confer specific axonal projection characteristics to subcerebral, corticothalamic, and callosal projection neurons. Diffusible factors like FGF8 and WNT also play roles in controlling the relative size and positioning of cortical areas. Concurrently, GABAergic interneurons, crucial for cortical circuitry, differentiate from progenitor cells in the ventricular zones of the subpallial ganglionic eminences. These interneurons migrate tangentially into the cortex, populating all layers. Their final cortical location and subtype specification (e.g., parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SST), and vasointestinal peptide (VIP) expressing interneurons) are influenced by genes like Dlx1/2, Nkx2.1, and Lhx6. Disruptions to these intricate developmental processes, whether by genetic or environmental factors, can impair intellectual function and elevate the risk for neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). These disorders are often associated with common convergent pathways affecting lamination, cortical layer expansion or reduction, and excitatory-inhibitory balance. While mice are extensively used to model neurodevelopment and brain disorders, a comprehensive cellular catalog of the normally developing mouse cerebral cortex has been lacking. Transcriptomic approaches, particularly single-cell transcriptomics, offer the potential to profile gene expression in individual cells, enabling the unique classification of neural cell types based on their combinatorial gene expression patterns.

"Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is an exceptionally lethal malignancy, often arising from the transformation of more indolent differentiated thyroid cancers (DTCs), such as papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC).

ATC is characterized by its undifferentiated morphology and a dismal prognosis, with a 5-year survival rate of only 7% and limited therapeutic options, particularly for patients with non-BRAF mutated tumors. While DTCs are typically indolent, a significant portion of ATC cases either have a prior history of DTC or present with synchronous DTC regions, strongly suggesting an evolutionary process of dedifferentiation within the tumor.

"Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with lung adenocarcinoma being the most common subtype, particularly in non-smokers. Current clinical management relies on molecular profiling for targeted therapies and PD-L1 expression for immune checkpoint inhibitors. However, there is a pressing need for more precise patient stratification to improve prognostic accuracy and treatment strategies. The tumor microenvironment (TME), a complex ecosystem of malignant epithelial cells, non-malignant immune cells, and stromal cells, plays a critical role in cancer progression, aggressiveness, immune modulation, extracellular matrix remodeling, and neoangiogenesis. Characterizing the cellular diversity and interactions within the TME is challenging due to the heterogeneity of its cell populations, some of which can be scarce yet functionally important. Traditional bulk omics analyses have limitations in dissecting this cellular complexity at high resolution. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a powerful technology to comprehensively profile individual cells within patient tissues, offering the potential to unravel the intricate cellular landscape of tumors and identify clinically relevant cell types and states. This study was motivated by the need for an in-depth characterization of both the cancer cells and the diverse non-malignant cell populations in the TME of human lung adenocarcinoma to identify features that could provide additional prognostic information and reveal potential therapeutic targets. The research aims to extend previous single-cell studies by providing a comprehensive atlas of lung adenocarcinoma, potentially revealing novel tumor subtypes based on both carcinoma cell characteristics and TME features.","['Single-cell RNA-seq Data Preprocessing, Quality Control, and Normalization', 'Computational Doublet Detection', 'Global Cell Atlas Construction and Visualization', 'Identification and Quantification of Major Cell Lineages', 'Epithelial Cell Sub-clustering and Characterization', 'Copy Number Variation (CNV) Estimation for Tumor Cell Identification', 'Identification of Inter-patient Differentially Expressed Genes in Tumor Epithelial Cells', 'Oncogenic Pathway Activity Quantification in Tumor Epithelial Cells', 'Principal Component Analysis of Tumor Epithelial Cell Transcriptomes for Differentiation State Assessment', 'Stromal Cell Sub-clustering and Characterization', 'Pathway Activity Analysis in Stromal Cell Subsets', 'Immune Cell Sub-clustering and Characterization', 'Functional State Characterization of Immune Subsets', 'Systematic Identification of Cell Cluster Marker Genes', 'Receptor-Ligand Interaction Analysis', 'Integration of Cell Proportions to Define Global TME Patterns', 'Translation of scRNA-seq Signatures to Bulk TCGA Data using ssGSEA', 'Prognostic Evaluation of scRNA-seq Derived Signatures in Bulk TCGA Data']","[{'title': 'Single-cell RNA-seq Data Preprocessing, Quality Control, and Normalization', 'description': ""UMI counts were quantified using Cellranger (v3.0.2) with GRCh38 reference.

"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is an aggressive malignancy with highly skewed ethnic and geographic distributions, being particularly prevalent in East and Southeast Asia, southern China, North and East Africa. Etiologically, NPC is strongly correlated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. A pathological hallmark of NPC is the heavy infiltration of immune cells around and within tumor lesions, indicating a remarkably complex tumor microenvironment (TME). This complex TME suggests potential benefits for immunotherapy. Indeed, checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1/PD-L1 have shown clinical benefit in NPC patients; however, the response rate is relatively low (20%-30%). This highlights an urgent unmet clinical need to gain a deeper understanding of the NPC TME to identify novel therapeutic targets and reliable biomarkers for risk stratification. Current genomic and transcriptomic analysis strategies for NPC primarily rely on bulk samples, which often come from small-sized tumors. These bulk approaches lack the necessary resolution and accuracy to fully depict the complex heterogeneity inherent in the TME.

"Gastrulation is a fundamental and pivotal process in all multicellular animals, responsible for laying down the basic body plan, generating cellular diversity, and coordinating spatial patterning. In humans, this critical developmental stage occurs in the third week after fertilization (approximately 14 days post-fertilization, continuing for about a week). However, our understanding of human gastrulation remains relatively limited. This is primarily due to the rarity and ethical challenges associated with obtaining and studying human embryonic material at these early stages, making direct investigation nearly impossible. Consequently, existing knowledge has been largely extrapolated from historical studies of fixed human specimens, observations in various animal model systems (like mouse), and more recently, from in vitro models. These in vitro systems include human embryonic stem (ES) cells cultured on micropatterns, human ES cell colonies engrafted into chick embryos, and 3D cellular models (e.g., gastruloids) derived from human ES cells. Additionally, human embryos cultured in vitro have allowed study of the stages immediately preceding gastrulation. A significant gap in the field has been the absence of transcriptional data from in utero human gastrulation, which is crucial for benchmarking and validating these in vitro models and for providing a direct molecular understanding of this inaccessible period of human development.

"The hematopoietic system, responsible for the continuous generation of all blood cell lineages—erythrocytes/megakaryocytes, myeloid cells, and lymphocytes—from a common pool of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), plays vital roles throughout the human lifespan. Dysregulation of hematopoiesis can lead to severe diseases, including immunodeficiency and blood cancers. In recent years, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a powerful tool to explore the cellular and molecular heterogeneity inherent in hematopoietic cell differentiation. Previous studies utilizing scRNA-seq have shed light on the differentiation hierarchy of early hematopoiesis and characterized specific progenitor populations, such as lineage- CD34+CD38- cells, as a transcriptional continuum. Despite these significant advances, a systematic and comprehensive transcriptomic reference map of the entire human blood system, derived from a large number of individuals and encompassing a wide array of well-defined blood cell types profiled with deep scRNA-seq, has been notably absent. Furthermore, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are increasingly recognized as crucial regulators in various aspects of hematopoietic cell differentiation and development, including HSC maintenance, erythropoiesis, and the development of B and T lymphocytes. While some studies have defined lncRNAs at the single-cell level during human HSPC differentiation and identified specific lncRNAs like H19 as pivotal for embryonic HSC emergence, the full repertoire and expression landscape of lncRNAs across the diverse spectrum of mature human blood cells remained to be comprehensively elucidated.

"Ovarian cancer is a highly lethal gynecological malignancy, primarily because it is often diagnosed at advanced stages when the cancer has already metastasized. The omentum, an apron-like fatty tissue in the abdomen, is a frequent site for ovarian cancer metastasis. The tumor microenvironment (TME) in metastatic ovarian cancer is complex, comprising cancer cells, stromal cells (like fibroblasts and adipocytes), and a diverse array of immune cells. Understanding the cellular heterogeneity and the intricate interactions within this TME at a single-cell level is crucial, as bulk tissue analyses average out signals and mask the contributions of rare but potentially significant cell subsets. Previous studies using immunohistochemistry or flow cytometry have categorized cell types based on a limited number of markers, often overlooking deeper intracellular heterogeneity and transcriptional states. While bulk RNA sequencing has helped define molecular subtypes of ovarian cancer, it cannot resolve the specific cellular compositions that underpin these subtypes or fully delineate the immune landscape. The omentum itself is not a passive site; it's rich in adipocytes that can provide energy for cancer cells and contains ""milky spots"" – aggregates of immune cells similar to lymph nodes – which play a role in peritoneal immunity. However, the immune response in the omental TME is often subverted by the cancer. Macrophages can be recruited and polarized towards tumor-supportive phenotypes, and while the presence of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells is generally associated with better prognosis, cancer immunotherapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors aimed at reinvigorating T cell function, have shown limited efficacy in ovarian cancer patients. This underscores a critical need to achieve a more granular understanding of the immune cell types, their functional states, and their organization within the metastatic omentum to guide the development of more effective personalized immunotherapies.

"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly lethal cancer, frequently diagnosed at advanced stages, underscoring the need for effective early detection methods. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are recognized precursor lesions that can progress to PDAC. These IPMNs, often found as asymptomatic pancreatic cysts, present a clinical challenge in distinguishing indolent forms from those with high-grade dysplasia (HGD) or invasive cancer, as current diagnostic criteria (e.g., Sendai and Fukuoka criteria) lack optimal sensitivity and specificity. While key driver mutations like KRAS and GNAS are known in IPMNs and help distinguish them from other pancreatic cysts, they do not reliably predict aggressive potential or progression to cancer.

"The skin serves as the body's outermost organ, acting as a critical mechanical and immunologic barrier against pathogens and environmental damage. The development of the skin's immune system is a complex process that occurs in stages. While studies in mice have provided significant insights into the origin, development, and features of various immune cells in embryonic skin, such as Langerhans cells (LCs), γδT cells, macrophages, and innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), the developmental dynamics of immune cells in human skin, particularly during early fetal life, remain largely uncharacterized. Human fetal hematopoiesis, the process that generates blood and immune cells, begins in the yolk sac (YS) at 2-3 weeks of gestation, followed by intra-embryonic progenitors in the aorta-gonad mesonephros (AGM) region at 3-4 weeks. These progenitors colonize fetal tissues like the liver (major hematopoietic site from 5-6 weeks gestation) and later the bone marrow (predominant after 20 weeks). These early progenitors also migrate to peripheral tissues, including the skin, where they undergo specific maturation programs. Understanding this process in humans is hampered by the scarcity of fetal skin tissue specimens and the technical challenges associated with studying the small number of cells available from early embryonic stages. Key questions revolve around the diversity of immune cells present in human fetal skin, their developmental trajectories, the heterogeneity and dynamics of crucial populations like macrophages and ILCs, and how these cells acquire tissue-specific characteristics, potentially involving processes like metabolic reprogramming and shifts in transcription factor networks.

"Lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) accounts for approximately 30% of all lung cancer cases and is a significant cause of cancer-related mortality globally. Despite its prevalence, LUSC has received comparatively less research attention than other lung cancer types like adenocarcinoma, leading to a limited understanding of its specific molecular abnormalities. The clinical staging of LUSC, primarily based on tumor size, lymph node involvement, and metastasis, is crucial for guiding treatment strategies and predicting prognosis. However, patients within the same LUSC stage often exhibit substantial variations in clinical outcomes, underscoring the limitations of current staging methods. Incorporating additional factors, such as molecular markers or genetic alterations, is needed to enhance prognostic accuracy and tailor treatment strategies. The tumor microenvironment (TME), which comprises diverse immune cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and other components, plays a critical role in cancer. The composition and functional states of immune cells within the TME profoundly influence prognosis and the efficacy of immunotherapy. However, existing staging methods for LUSC do not comprehensively characterize the TME specific to this cancer type. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a powerful technique to investigate gene expression patterns at high resolution within tumor samples. This technology allows for the profiling of individual cells, providing valuable insights into the composition, activation states, and interactions of cells within the TME. This study aims to leverage scRNA-seq to comprehensively characterize the TME in LUSC, elucidate the interplay between TME components, identify distinct malignant cell phenotypes, and explore potential clinical implications for targeted therapies and patient prognosis, particularly for early-stage disease.","['Global Cell Atlas Construction and Major Cell Type Identification in LUSC TME', 'Malignant Cell Identification using Inferred Copy Number Variation (CNV) Analysis', 'Analysis of Major Cell Type Proportions Across LUSC Tumor Stages', 'T-cell Subpopulation Identification and Proportional Analysis Across Tumor Stages', 'Myeloid Cell Subpopulation Identification and Proportional Analysis Across Tumor Stages', 'Non-Malignant Epithelial Cell Subpopulation Identification and Proportional Analysis Across Tumor Stages', 'Characterization of Intratumor Heterogeneity in Malignant Cells using Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)']","[{'title': 'Global Cell Atlas Construction and Major Cell Type Identification in LUSC TME', 'description': 'scRNA-seq data from 72 LUSC samples (22 from GSE148071 and 50 from WCH, totaling 179,506 cells) were merged.

"The paper investigates psoriasis vulgaris, the most common inflammatory skin disease in humans, which is known to be mediated by IL-17-producing type 17 T (T17) cells. These T17 cells, encompassing CD4+ (TH17) and CD8+ (cytotoxic type 17 T cells) subsets, exhibit heterogeneity; individual T cells can synthesize different isoforms of IL-17 (IL-17A, IL-17F, or IL-17A/F heterodimers), each with varying capacities to activate IL-17 receptors. However, the specific expression patterns of pathogenic versus regulatory markers within these distinct IL-17A- versus IL-17F-producing T cell populations in psoriatic skin were previously unknown. The chronic nature of psoriasis lesions is hypothesized to stem from defective negative regulatory pathways, such as impaired function of regulatory T (Treg) cells or reduced type 1 Treg (Tr1) cells. While Treg cell function has been studied in peripheral blood, their properties and those of other regulatory immune cells within human skin remain largely unexplored. 
In normal skin, a subset of myeloid dendritic cells (DCs) characterized by BDCA-3 expression and IL-10 production are considered regulatory, contributing to immune homeostasis. Conversely, psoriasis lesions show an increase in 'inflammatory' CD11c+ DCs and mature DC populations. The balance of inflammatory versus regulatory molecule expression within DC populations in psoriatic lesions has not been extensively characterized. 
A significant challenge in previous single-cell studies of human skin has been the low abundance of inflammatory cells relative to the overall cell population, making it difficult to ascertain and study functional immune subsets. Specifically, leukocyte subsets have been hard to study in-depth because other skin cells like fibroblasts and keratinocytes (KCs) dominate the cell mixture. Traditional methods often require cell sorting or activation, which can alter gene expression. 
The objective of this study was to overcome this limitation by applying single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to cells that emigrate from human psoriasis and control skin biopsies cultured ex vivo. This approach aimed to enrich for immune cell subsets without enzymatic digestion or cell sorting, thereby enabling the elucidation of ex vivo gene expression profiles of pathogenic versus regulatory immune cell subsets in psoriatic skin.","['Unsupervised Clustering and Annotation of Cell Types from Skin Biopsies', 'Comparative Analysis of Cell Type Proportions between Psoriasis and Control Skin', 'Differential Gene Expression Profiling of T-cell Subsets in Psoriasis versus Control Skin', 'Sub-clustering and Transcriptomic Characterization of Cutaneous T17 Cell Subsets', 'Differential Gene Expression Profiling of Dendritic Cell Subsets in Psoriasis versus Control Skin', 'Identification of Altered Keratinocyte Gene Expression Programs in Psoriasis by Epidermal Layer', 'Computational Prediction of Altered Cell-Cell Communication Networks in Psoriasis']","[{'title': 'Unsupervised Clustering and Annotation of Cell Types from Skin Biopsies', 'description': ""Single cells were harvested from emigrating cells from human psoriasis skin and control skin biopsies after incubation in culture medium without enzyme digestion or cell sorting.

"The paper investigates head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), a type of epithelial tumor characterized by significant heterogeneity. This cellular diversity involves malignant cells, as well as various stromal and immune cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Interactions between these different cell populations are believed to critically influence tumor progression, its ability to metastasize, and how it responds to therapeutic interventions. Traditional genomic and transcriptomic studies, which typically analyze tumor tissues in bulk, have inherent limitations in dissecting this intra-tumoral heterogeneity. Consequently, a detailed understanding of the distinct cellular states and their contributions to HNSCC biology, particularly the processes of invasion and metastasis, remains incomplete. Metastasis to lymph nodes is a major clinical challenge in HNSCC, significantly impacting patient prognosis. There is an ongoing need to understand the molecular features that distinguish primary tumors from their metastases, but comparisons are often confounded by the differing cellular compositions of these sites. Furthermore, processes like epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) have been implicated in tumor dissemination and metastasis, but its precise role and characteristics within primary human tumors and during metastatic spread in vivo are still subjects of active research and debate. This study aims to provide a high-resolution map of the cellular landscape in HNSCC using single-cell transcriptomics to better understand these complex aspects of cancer biology, focusing on intra-tumoral heterogeneity, invasion, and metastasis in primary tumors and matched lymph node metastases.","['Distinction of Malignant and Non-Malignant Cells from scRNA-seq Data', 'Characterization of Non-Malignant Cell Heterogeneity in the Tumor Microenvironment', 'Sub-clustering and Annotation of T Cell Populations', 'Sub-clustering and Annotation of Fibroblast Populations', 'Analysis of Inter-Tumoral Malignant Cell Heterogeneity', 'Identification of Intra-Tumoral Malignant Cell Expression Programs using NNMF', 'Characterization of the Partial Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (p-EMT) Program', 'Transcriptomic Comparison of Malignant Cells from Primary Tumors and Matched Lymph Node Metastases', 'Comparison of Non-Malignant Cell Composition and States between Primary Tumors and Matched Lymph Node Metastases', 'Correlation of Single-Cell Malignant Cell Signatures with TCGA Bulk Tumor Subtypes', 'Correlation of Single-Cell Non-Malignant Cell Signatures with TCGA Bulk Tumor Subtypes', 'Analysis of Correlations between the p-EMT Program and Other Intra-Tumoral Expression Programs', 'Prediction of Ligand-Receptor Interactions between Malignant and TME Cells using scRNA-seq Expression']","[{'title': 'Distinction of Malignant and Non-Malignant Cells from scRNA-seq Data', 'description': 'Large-scale chromosomal copy-number variations (CNVs) were inferred for each single cell by averaging expression profiles of 100 genes across chromosomal intervals.

"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory loss and cognitive decline. The underlying pathophysiology is complex, involving interactions between neurons and glial cells. Previous transcriptomic and epigenomic studies at the bulk-tissue level have indicated downregulation of neuronal functions and upregulation of innate immune responses in AD brains. However, bulk-tissue analysis can obscure the detailed changes occurring across diverse cell types and within specific cell populations, especially for less abundant cell types. Furthermore, bulk methods can be confounded by changes in cell composition during neurodegeneration, making it difficult to distinguish between alterations in cell numbers versus changes in cell activity. The complex interplay of protective and damaging molecular processes within and across different cell types also complicates the interpretation of tissue-level signatures. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers a powerful alternative to overcome these limitations by enabling the profiling of transcriptomes from tens of thousands of individual cells, thus providing a high-resolution view of cellular heterogeneity and responses in complex tissues like the brain. This study utilizes scRNA-seq to investigate the cellular and molecular complexity of AD. Post-mortem human brain samples from the prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area 10), a region significantly affected by AD-related cognitive decline, were obtained from 48 participants of the Religious Orders Study (ROS) and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP). These participants included 24 individuals with high levels of β-amyloid and other AD pathological hallmarks ('AD-pathology') and 24 individuals with no or very low β-amyloid burden or other pathologies ('no-pathology'), balanced for sex. The pathological status of these samples was confirmed using immunohistochemistry for β-amyloid, and the integrity of isolated nuclei was verified by microscopy.","['Initial Cell Type Identification and Characterization from snRNA-seq Data', ""Cell-Type Specific Differential Gene Expression (DEG) Analysis in Alzheimer's Disease"", ""Analysis of Transcriptional Changes Across Alzheimer's Disease Progression Stages"", 'Correlation of Cell-Type Specific Gene Expression with AD-Related Neuropathological Traits', 'Identification and Profiling of Disease-Associated Cellular Subpopulations', 'Investigation of Sex-Specific Transcriptional Responses to AD Pathology']","[{'title': 'Initial Cell Type Identification and Characterization from snRNA-seq Data', 'description': 'A total of 80,660 single-nucleus transcriptomes from the prefrontal cortex of 48 individuals were jointly pre-clustered (20 pre-clusters).

"Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an extremely aggressive and lethal subtype of lung cancer, characterized by rapid growth, early metastasis, and acquired resistance to therapies like radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Despite being designated a recalcitrant malignancy, there has been minimal improvement in treatment outcomes over several decades. Recent incorporation of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) into SCLC treatment has shown initial milestones, but the clinical benefits are limited, with only a small fraction of patients responding. Currently, reliable biomarkers to predict clinical outcomes or therapeutic responses, including to ICIs, are lacking. While SCLC has historically been viewed as genetically homogeneous, often marked by universal loss of TP53 and RB1, recent transcriptomic studies at the bulk level have suggested the existence of molecular subtypes. These subtypes are defined by the relative expression of key transcription factors such as ASCL1, NEUROD1, POU2F3, and YAP1, and they are thought to mediate distinct vulnerabilities. However, these previous studies predominantly focused on intertumor heterogeneity, thereby limiting the exploration of intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) – the diversity among cancer cells within a single tumor. Furthermore, the complex interactions between malignant cells and various nonmalignant cell components (e.g., immune cells, stromal cells) within the SCLC tumor microenvironment (TME) are critical for tumor biology and therapeutic response but remain poorly understood. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies offer a powerful approach to dissect this cellular complexity, profile individual cell components within the TME, and investigate their roles in tumorigenesis. However, scRNA-seq studies on human SCLC, particularly those involving matched primary tumors, normal adjacent tissues, and relapsed tumors, have been scarce, partly due to the limited availability of surgical specimens for this cancer type. This paper addresses the urgent need for a better understanding of SCLC biology at a single-cell resolution to uncover its heterogeneity and potentially develop new therapeutic strategies.","['Single-cell Atlas Construction and Cell Type Identification in SCLC', 'Inference and Validation of Copy Number Variations (CNVs) using scRNA-seq Data', 'Detailed Characterization of the SCLC Immune Microenvironment using scRNA-seq', 'Analysis of Transcriptional Heterogeneity within SCLC Malignant Cells using scRNA-seq', 'Single-Cell Resolution Molecular Subtyping of SCLC Malignant Cells', 'Pseudotime Trajectory and Cellular Hierarchy Inference for SCLC Malignant Cell States using scRNA-seq', 'Functional Annotation of Intratumor SCLC Subtypes identified by scRNA-seq', 'Mapping Cell-Cell Communication Networks in the SCLC TME using scRNA-seq', 'scRNA-seq Profiling of Tumor Evolution in Matched Primary and Relapsed SCLC']","[{'title': 'Single-cell Atlas Construction and Cell Type Identification in SCLC', 'description': 'Modified Single-Cell Tagged Reverse Transcription sequencing (STRT-seq) was performed on approximately 4911 cells obtained from primary tumors (PTs), matched normal adjacent tissues (NATs), and one relapsed tumor (RT) from 11 SCLC patients after quality controls.

"Atherosclerosis, a primary cause of cardiovascular disease (CVD), is recognized as a chronic, lipid-driven vascular inflammatory condition characterized by significant cellular heterogeneity within lesions. Historically, the cellular composition of atherosclerotic plaques has been investigated primarily through methods relying on a limited set of pre-selected marker proteins or bulk tissue analyses, which may obscure the full spectrum of cell types and states. While early applications of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have demonstrated its power as an unbiased tool, particularly for immune cells in murine models or smaller human cohorts focusing on specific plaque locations like the aorta, a comprehensive molecular and cellular atlas of advanced human carotid atherosclerotic plaques, encompassing the diversity of both immune and non-immune cells and their functional states, has remained a critical unmet need. Furthermore, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified numerous genetic loci associated with increased CVD risk. However, a significant challenge lies in translating these genetic findings into new therapeutic strategies. This is largely due to a lack of detailed information on which specific cell types within the complex plaque environment are affected by these disease-associated genetic variants and how these variants modulate gene expression patterns at the actual site of disease. A deeper understanding of the precise cellular constituents, their molecular profiles, their potential for phenotypic plasticity, and their interactions within the atherosclerotic plaque is therefore essential for elucidating disease mechanisms and identifying novel, cell-specific targets for therapeutic intervention.","['Global Cell Type Identification and Clustering in Human Atherosclerotic Plaques', 'Subclustering and Phenotypic Characterization of Endothelial Cells (ECs)', 'Subclustering and Phenotypic Characterization of Smooth Muscle Cells (SMCs)', 'Subclustering and Phenotypic Characterization of T Cells', 'Subclustering and Phenotypic Characterization of Myeloid Cells', 'Cross-Species Comparison of Human and Murine Plaque Macrophage Subsets', 'Prediction of Intercellular Communication Networks within the Plaque', 'Cell-Type Specific Expression Analysis of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) GWAS-Associated Genes']","[{'title': 'Global Cell Type Identification and Clustering in Human Atherosclerotic Plaques', 'description': 'Single viable nucleated cells were isolated from enzymatically digested carotid endarterectomy tissue from 18 patients using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). scRNA-seq libraries were prepared using the CEL-seq2 protocol.

"Supercentenarians, individuals who live to 110 years or older, represent a unique model of healthy human aging. They exhibit a delayed onset of age-related diseases and a compression of morbidity, suggesting their immune systems remain highly functional even at extreme ages. Understanding the immunological characteristics of supercentenarians could provide valuable insights into mechanisms of longevity and sustained health. General aging is associated with immunosenescence, a decline in immune function, leading to increased susceptibility to infections, cancer, and autoimmune conditions. This involves changes in primary lymphoid organs, a myeloid bias in hematopoietic stem cell differentiation, and alterations in peripheral lymphocyte populations. For instance, B cell numbers typically decrease with age, while naïve T cell numbers decline and antigen-experienced memory T cells, particularly CD8+ T cells, often expand. Previous transcriptomic studies on peripheral blood have identified age-associated gene expression patterns, sometimes used to predict a 'transcriptomic age.' However, most of these studies have focused on individuals up to 100 years old, leaving the immune landscape of supercentenarians largely uncharacterized. The rapid advancements in single-cell transcriptomic technologies offer an unprecedented opportunity to dissect the heterogeneity of immune cells and their gene expression profiles at single-cell resolution, which is crucial for uncovering unique adaptive immune signatures that might contribute to exceptional longevity.","['Single-Cell Transcriptome Profiling of PBMCs for Global Immune Cell Type Identification', 'Sub-clustering and Phenotypic Characterization of B Cell Populations', 'Re-clustering of T Cells for Identification and Characterization of Cytotoxic and Non-cytotoxic Subsets', 'Quantification of Cytotoxic Gene Expression Signatures within T Cell Subsets', 'Transcriptional Classification of Cytotoxic T Cells into CD4, CD8, and γδ Lineages', 'Analysis of CD4 CTL Frequencies in Publicly Available scRNA-seq Data from Younger Donors', 'Pseudotime Trajectory Inference of T Cell Differentiation States', 'Comparative Pseudotime Analysis of CD4 CTL and CD8 CTL Differentiation Trajectories', 'Integrated Single-Cell Gene Expression and T-Cell Receptor (TCR) Repertoire Profiling of CD4+ T Cells', 'Pseudotime Trajectory Analysis of Clonally Expanded CD4+ T Cells']","[{'title': 'Single-Cell Transcriptome Profiling of PBMCs for Global Immune Cell Type Identification', 'description': ""Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 7 supercentenarians and 5 younger controls (total 61,202 cells) were profiled using droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing (10x Genomics 3' v2).

"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a significant genetic heart disease, with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 200 to 500 individuals. It is primarily defined by unexplained thickening of the heart muscle, most commonly affecting the interventricular septum. The clinical presentation of HCM is diverse, ranging from asymptomatic individuals to those experiencing severe outcomes like end-stage heart failure or life-threatening arrhythmias. Genetically, HCM is often linked to mutations in genes that encode sarcomeric proteins, particularly ẞ-myosin heavy chain (MYH7) and myosin binding protein C (MYBPC3). However, for approximately 40% of HCM patients, the specific causal genetic mutation remains unidentified.
Pathologically, HCM is characterized by several key features. Myocyte disarray, a disorganized arrangement of cardiac muscle cells, is a hallmark, typically found in 5% to 40% of the myocardium and predominantly in regions with more severe hypertrophy. Other important histological characteristics include interstitial fibrosis and abnormalities in the cardiac vasculature. Despite these known features, the detailed molecular mechanisms that drive the cardiac remodeling processes in HCM, including the development of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and the notable heterogeneity observed in the disease, are still largely unclear. Current hypotheses propose that the HCM phenotype could arise from direct consequences of altered sarcomere function due to the mutations, or it might be initiated by a functional imbalance among individual cardiomyocytes. Such an imbalance, possibly from unequal force generation between adjacent cells, could trigger myocyte disarray and activate stretch-induced signaling pathways, ultimately leading to fibrosis and hypertrophy.
A more profound understanding of the complex gene networks that govern cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and the overall disease pathogenesis is essential for developing improved therapeutic strategies for HCM. Surgical septal myectomy, a procedure performed in some HCM patients to relieve outflow tract obstruction caused by septal hypertrophy, offers a valuable source of human cardiac tissue for research. While advanced molecular techniques like single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) offer the potential to provide highly detailed views of gene expression at the individual cell level, thereby elucidating cellular heterogeneity and specific transcriptional states, their application to comprehensively investigate cardiomyocytes directly from human HCM myectomy samples has been limited. This represents an important area where further research could yield significant insights into the molecular underpinnings of HCM.","['Generation and Characterization of Single-Cardiomyocyte Transcriptomes from HCM Patients', 'Identification of HCM-Specific Gene Expression Signatures by Comparison with Healthy Cardiomyocytes', 'Characterization of Transcriptional Heterogeneity and Subpopulation Identification within HCM Cardiomyocytes', 'Defining the NPPA-Correlated Gene Expression Network in HCM Cardiomyocytes from scRNA-seq Data', 'Elucidation of the XIRP2-Correlated Gene Expression Network in HCM Cardiomyocytes from scRNA-seq Data', 'Inferring Gene Regulatory Networks and Key Transcription Factors in HCM Cardiomyocytes using SCENIC', 'Discovery of Co-regulated Gene Modules in HCM Cardiomyocytes Independent of TF Expression Patterns', 'Correlating Single-Cell Transcriptomes with Cardiomyocyte Size in HCM using FACS Index Sorting Data']","[{'title': 'Generation and Characterization of Single-Cardiomyocyte Transcriptomes from HCM Patients', 'description': 'Cardiac tissue from septal myectomies of five HCM patients was enzymatically dissociated.

"Diabetic foot ulceration (DFU) is a severe and debilitating complication of diabetes mellitus, the pathogenesis of which remains incompletely understood. DFUs significantly impair patients' quality of life, frequently lead to prolonged hospitalizations, and are a major cause of lower extremity amputations, carrying a mortality rate higher than many cancers. With the global rise in diabetes prevalence, DFUs represent an increasing burden on healthcare systems and are among the costliest diabetes complications. The development of chronic wounds in diabetic patients, particularly in the foot, is often linked to impaired wound healing mechanisms, exacerbated by neuropathy and/or peripheral vascular disease. While various cell types, including endothelial cells, fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and diverse immune cells, are known to play critical roles in the normal wound healing cascade, their specific contributions to the impaired healing observed in DFU are not well delineated. 

A deeper understanding of the cellular and molecular differences is needed. This includes comparing DFU patients whose ulcers heal versus those who develop chronic, non-healing ulcers; contrasting diabetic patients with and without DFU against healthy non-diabetic individuals; and examining differences between affected foot tissue and unaffected skin (e.g., forearm), as well as systemic changes reflected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers a powerful approach to gain insights into cell function and disease pathophysiology by enabling the transcriptomic profiling of individual cells within complex, heterogeneous tissues. Previous research has suggested that individuals with diabetes and DFU exhibit increased inflammatory cell presence and distinct fibroblast cluster profiles, possibly linked to chronic inflammation associated with diabetes. Furthermore, newer technologies like spatial transcriptomics allow for the visualization and quantification of transcriptomes within intact tissue sections, preserving spatial context. 

The primary research focus is to elucidate the differences between DFU patients whose ulcers heal (DFU-Healers) and those whose ulcers do not heal within a 12-week timeframe (DFU-Non-healers). The underlying hypothesis is that diabetic patients experiencing impaired wound healing possess aberrant gene and protein expression profiles, which result in the dysregulation of critical processes such as epithelial remodeling and inflammatory pathways. To investigate this, the study planned to analyze molecular changes using scRNA-seq on DFU biopsies, forearm skin biopsies, and PBMCs collected from DFU patients (both healers and non-healers). Control groups included diabetic patients without DFU and healthy non-diabetic individuals, from whom similar foot and forearm biopsies and PBMCs were to be analyzed. Additionally, the study aimed to compare different sites within a chronic wound (wound site, periphery, and healthy skin) to validate findings.","['Global single-cell profiling and cell type identification across clinical groups and tissues', 'Comparative analysis of cell type abundance across clinical groups', 'Definition of cell cluster-specific gene signatures', 'Comparative analysis of cellular heterogeneity and transcriptomes across anatomical sites', 'Transcriptomic analysis of PBMCs to investigate systemic dysregulation in DFU', 'Sub-clustering and characterization of T, NK, and NKT cell populations', 'Focused transcriptomic analysis of foot ulcer cells across clinical groups', 'Differential gene expression and pathway analysis in M1 macrophages from foot ulcers', 'Identification of differentially expressed genes in forearm keratinocytes related to DFU healing status', 'Fibroblast sub-clustering, characterization, and association with DFU healing', 'Ligand-receptor interaction analysis among HE-Fibro sub-clusters', 'RNA velocity analysis to predict cellular differentiation trajectories in DFU', 'scRNA-seq analysis of spatially distinct regions from a single chronic wound']","[{'title': 'Global single-cell profiling and cell type identification across clinical groups and tissues', 'description': 'Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on 174,962 cells isolated from foot tissue (n=94,325), forearm skin (n=37,182), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs, n=43,455).

"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative movement disorder with an insidious onset, affecting a significant portion of the older population. Its core pathological hallmark is the progressive degeneration of midbrain-type dopaminergic neurons located in the substantia nigra. Clinically, PD manifests with typical motor symptoms such as stiffness, tremors, and bradykinesia, alongside a range of non-motor disorders including cognitive and sensory impairments. Despite considerable research efforts, the precise mechanisms underlying PD pathogenesis are not yet fully understood. Current therapeutic options are primarily symptomatic; they do not address the root causes of the disease, nor can they halt or reverse the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, these treatments often lose effectiveness over time and can lead to undesirable side effects. This underscores a pressing need for novel therapeutic strategies that target the fundamental mechanisms of PD. Traditional high-throughput sequencing approaches, which analyze bulk tissue samples, provide an averaged view of gene expression and thus cannot capture the cellular diversity within complex tissues. In contrast, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology allows for the transcriptomic analysis of individual cells. This capability is crucial for revealing cell-specific gene expression patterns, understanding gene regulatory dynamics at a finer resolution, and characterizing the heterogeneity among cell populations. Previous studies utilizing scRNA-seq in the context of PD have already demonstrated its value. For instance, scRNA-seq has been applied to identify the composition of cell grafts derived from stem cells in PD models, to reconstruct the developmental trajectory of PD, to correct cellular phenotypes of dopamine neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, and to uncover specific stress responses in dopamine neurons affected by PD. These examples highlight the significant potential of scRNA-seq to deepen our understanding of PD progression and to contribute to the development of innovative cell replacement therapies and other interventions.

"Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a significant clinical problem frequently encountered in hospitalized patients, especially those who are critically ill. It is associated with poor patient outcomes, including high morbidity and mortality, and increased healthcare costs. Despite its considerable clinical and economic impact, the therapeutic options for AKI are largely restricted to supportive care and kidney replacement therapies like hemodialysis or hemofiltration for advanced kidney failure. There is a pressing unmet need for targeted therapies that can prevent AKI or promote recovery. A major hurdle in developing such therapies is the incomplete understanding of the cellular mechanisms that drive AKI and how different kidney cells respond to injury. AKI is not a single uniform disease but rather a syndrome defined by clinical criteria (changes in serum creatinine and/or urine output). However, there is substantial underlying heterogeneity and complexity, with potentially many different molecular subtypes of AKI. This complexity suggests that personalized or stratified therapeutic approaches may be necessary for effective treatment. Historically, research into AKI mechanisms has relied heavily on animal models and studies of bulk human tissue. While these have provided valuable insights, studies offering a detailed, cell type-specific understanding of gene expression changes in human AKI, particularly in a controlled clinical setting, have been scarce. The recent COVID-19 pandemic further highlighted the issue of AKI subtypes, as high rates of AKI were observed in COVID-19 patients, sparking debate about whether COVID-19 induces a unique molecular form of AKI, possibly through direct renal viral infection or distinct systemic inflammatory effects. Unraveling the cell type-specific responses and potential molecular subtypes of AKI is crucial for identifying new therapeutic targets and biomarkers. Advanced molecular profiling techniques that can provide high-resolution information at the single-cell level hold significant promise for dissecting this cellular heterogeneity and understanding the diverse kidney cell responses to injury.","['Single-Nuclei RNA Sequencing Data Processing, Quality Control, and Major Cell Type Identification', 'Subclustering of Major Renal Cell Types and Identification of Injury-Associated Cell States', 'Differential Abundance Analysis of Kidney Cell Subpopulations in AKI', 'Cell-Type Specific Differential Gene Expression Analysis between AKI and Control Kidneys', 'Pathway Enrichment Analysis of Differentially Expressed Genes in AKI', 'Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis of Kidney Tubular Epithelial Cell States', 'Cross-Species Comparison of Human Injured Proximal Tubule Cell States with a Mouse AKI Model', 'Validation of AKI-Associated Cell States using an Independent Human snRNA-seq Dataset', 'Comparative Gene Expression Analysis between COVID-19-Associated AKI and Non-COVID-19 AKI', 'Transcription Factor Enrichment Analysis for Novel Injury-Associated Cell States']","[{'title': 'Single-Nuclei RNA Sequencing Data Processing, Quality Control, and Major Cell Type Identification', 'description': ""Kidney specimens were processed for single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) using the 10x Genomics Next GEM Single Cell 3' v3.1 chemistry, targeting 10,000 nuclei, and sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 4000.

"Tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells (TIMs), which include monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils, are recognized as crucial regulators of cancer development and represent promising targets for next-generation immunotherapies. However, the diverse cellular states and functional roles of TIMs within the tumor microenvironment remain incompletely understood. Myeloid cells can differentiate into a spectrum of states that may either promote or inhibit tumor growth, but these states are often poorly characterized. Traditional methods for studying TIMs, such as flow cytometry and histology, rely on pre-defined marker panels and may not capture the full heterogeneity or novel cell states, especially if marker expression changes within the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, significant challenges exist in translating findings from murine cancer models to human patients due to inherent differences between mouse and human immune systems, including variations in marker gene expression for key myeloid lineages. This complicates the study of myeloid cell biology and raises concerns about the suitability of mouse models for predicting human immune responses to therapies. Lung cancer serves as a pertinent disease model for such investigations due to its high prevalence, frequent resistance to existing treatments, and the limited accessibility of patient tumor tissue, which necessitates robust animal models. This study addresses the need for a deeper understanding of TIM diversity and conservation across species and individuals by leveraging advanced transcriptomic techniques to characterize these critical immune populations in lung cancer.","['Single-Cell RNA-seq Profiling and Major Immune Cell Type Identification in Human and Mouse Lung Tissues', ""Cross-Species 'Low-Resolution' Comparison of Major Immune Cell Lineages"", 'Identification, Characterization, and Cross-Species Comparison of Neutrophil Subsets', 'Identification, Characterization, and Cross-Species Comparison of Dendritic Cell (DC) Subsets', 'Identification, Characterization, and Cross-Species Comparison of Monocyte and Macrophage Subsets', 'Differential Chemokine and Chemokine Receptor Expression Profiling in Myeloid Subsets', 'Identification of Prognostically Relevant Marker Genes for Human TIM Subsets', 'Comparative scRNA-seq Analysis of Myeloid Cell States between Peripheral Blood and Tumors in NSCLC Patients', 'Evaluation of Gene Expression Conservation for Immunological Tool and Target Genes', 'Analysis of Inter-Patient Heterogeneity in Immune Cell Composition', 'Characterization of Tumor-Specific Enrichment of Myeloid Subsets in Mice', 'Comparison of Human Tumor DC Subsets with Publicly Profiled Human Blood DC Subsets']","[{'title': 'Single-Cell RNA-seq Profiling and Major Immune Cell Type Identification in Human and Mouse Lung Tissues', 'description': 'Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed on fresh tumor tissue from seven human non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients (five lung adenocarcinoma, two squamous cell carcinoma), and on CD45+ cells isolated from lung tumors (KP1.9 lung adenocarcinoma model) and healthy lungs of mice.
